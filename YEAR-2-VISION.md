---

## üéØ Key Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions

1. **Marketplace takes off**: 100+ community schemas by Month 24
2. **Enterprise deals close**: 25 enterprises at $20K/year each
3. **Team execution**: 4 FTEs deliver features on time
4. **Churn stays low**: < 5% monthly churn (85%+ retention)
5. **Free ‚Üí Paid conversion**: 10% (50,000 free ‚Üí 5,000 paid)

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Marketplace fails (< 20 schemas)**
- **Impact**: High (no community growth, no marketplace revenue)
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Pay creators upfront ($500-$1K per schema), highlight top creators, improve discoverability

**Risk 2: Enterprise sales too slow (< 10 deals)**
- **Impact**: High (can't hit $100K MRR)
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Hire sales rep (Month 18), offer free trials, create case studies, lower price to $10K/year

**Risk 3: Team can't execute (features delayed)**
- **Impact**: High (lose competitive advantage)
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Hire experienced team, use Linear for prioritization, ship MVP versions first

**Risk 4: Burn too high (> $60K/month)**
- **Impact**: Medium (runway shortens)
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Optimize infra costs (Spot instances), delay hiring, cut marketing spend

**Risk 5: Competitor launches (Faker Pro, Mockaroo 2.0)**
- **Impact**: Medium (lose differentiation)
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Ship fast (marketplace first), build moat (community schemas), focus on API/integrations

| **MRR** | $10K | $100K | **10x** |
| **Paying users** | 100 | 10,000 | **100x** |
| **Schemas** | 6 (built-in) | 100+ (marketplace) | **16x** |
| **Integrations** | 0 | 8 (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) | **‚àû** |
| **Enterprise customers** | 0 | 25 ($500K ARR) | **‚àû** |
| **Team size** | 1 (founder) | 5 (founder + 4 FTEs) | **5x** |
| **Gross margin** | 92% | 85% | -7% |
| **Net margin** | 50% | 35% | -15% |

## üìù Decision Framework for Year 2

When making decisions during Year 2, ask:

1. **Does this move us toward $100K MRR?** (Yes ‚Üí prioritize, No ‚Üí defer)
2. **Does this expand the platform/marketplace?** (Yes ‚Üí prioritize, No ‚Üí defer)
3. **Does this enable enterprise sales?** (Yes ‚Üí prioritize, No ‚Üí defer)
4. **Does this require > 2 engineers for > 1 month?** (Yes ‚Üí break into phases, No ‚Üí build)
5. **Does this violate legal constraints?** (Yes ‚Üí reject, No ‚Üí consider)

**Examples**:
- Launch marketplace: ‚úÖ Yes (expands ecosystem, enables community)
- Add GraphQL API: ‚úÖ Yes (expands platform, enables integrations)
- Build visual schema builder: ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe (nice-to-have, defer to Q4)
- Add AI-generated schemas: ‚ùå No (not a priority, defer to Year 3)
- Integrate with Fivetran: ‚úÖ Yes (but only with public APIs, no proprietary info)
