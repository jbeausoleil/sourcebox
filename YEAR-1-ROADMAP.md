## 🚧 Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: MVP Takes Longer Than 3 Months
**Impact**: High (delays validation)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Cut scope: 2 schemas instead of 3, MySQL only (no Postgres)
- Hire freelance Go dev: $50-100/hr, 10-20 hours
- Timebox each week: If week goes over, cut features

### Risk 2: No Adoption (< 100 GitHub Stars by Month 4)
**Impact**: High (no validation)
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Validate before building: 20 developer interviews, survey responses
- Post on multiple channels: Hacker News, Reddit, dev.to, Twitter
- Iterate based on feedback: Top 5 feature requests, top 10 bugs

### Risk 3: Free → Paid Conversion Too Low (< 5%)
**Impact**: High (can't hit $10K MRR)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Add upgrade prompts: "You've used 3/3 free environments. Upgrade to Pro."
- Add referral program: "Refer a friend, get 1 month free Pro"
- Offer 1-month free trial: "Try Pro free for 1 month, no credit card"

### Risk 4: Legal/IP Issues (Employment Constraints)
**Impact**: High (company-ending)
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Independent development only: Personal equipment, outside work hours
- No employer resources: No employer APIs, no employer data
- Open source (MIT): Full transparency, no proprietary claims
- No employer references: All documentation excludes employer names

### Risk 5: AWS Costs Too High (> $200/month)
**Impact**: Medium (gross margin drops)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Use Spot instances: 70% discount (vs on-demand)
- Aggressive teardown: 4-hour default, auto-delete after TTL
- t3.micro instances: $10/month (vs t3.medium $60/month)
- Pass costs to customers: Charge $5/env if AWS charges > $2/env

## 📝 Decision Framework

When making decisions during Year 1, ask:

1. **Does this move us toward $10K MRR?** (Yes → prioritize, No → defer)
2. **Does this validate product-market fit?** (Yes → prioritize, No → defer)
3. **Does this violate legal constraints?** (Yes → reject, No → consider)
4. **Does this take > 2 weeks to build?** (Yes → break into smaller tasks, No → build)
5. **Does this require hiring?** (Yes → defer to Year 2, No → build)

**Examples**:
- Add MongoDB support (Month 6): ✅ Yes (expands TAM, validates demand)
- Add visual schema builder: ❌ No (nice-to-have, defer to Year 2)
- Use Fivetran for testing: ❌ No (violates legal constraints)
- Add SSO (SAML): ❌ No (enterprise feature, defer to Year 2)
- Add team billing: ✅ Yes (required for $10K MRR)
