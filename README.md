> Verticalized demo data for developers in 30 seconds

<!-- Test comment for PR workflow validation -->

## Legal Notice

**SourceBox is developed independently on personal equipment, outside of work hours, with no use of employer resources or proprietary information.**

## Problem Statement

Developers waste days or weeks provisioning realistic demo data for prototypes, presentations, and tests. Generic data generators produce bland, unconvincing results that don't reflect real-world domain complexity. SourceBox solves this by providing rich, verticalized demo datasets (e-commerce, healthcare, fintech) that developers can instantly integrate into their projects, letting them focus on building features instead of fabricating data.

## Features

- Fast demo data generation (target: under 30 seconds)
- Verticalized datasets for common industries
- Developer-friendly CLI interface
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Open source and MIT licensed

**Note**: SourceBox is in early development. Features listed above represent the project roadmap and are not yet implemented.

## Installation

Installation instructions will be available once the initial release is published. Check back soon!
