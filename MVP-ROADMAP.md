## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the path from concept to open source launch in 12 weeks. The approach is **validation-first** - we validate the problem with real developers before building, then iterate based on feedback.

**Key Milestones**:
- **Week 2**: 20 developer interviews completed, problem validated
- **Week 6**: CLI tool working (seed MySQL with fintech data < 30s)
- **Week 8**: Docker images published (Docker Hub)
- **Week 10**: Documentation site live (Docusaurus)
- **Week 11**: Alpha testing with 10 developers
- **Week 12**: Open source launch (GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 100+ GitHub stars in first week
- ✅ 500+ Docker Hub pulls in first month
- ✅ 20+ CLI installs (homebrew + npm) in first week
- ✅ 5+ developers say "This saves me hours per week"

---

## Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Problem Validation

**Goal**: Validate that developers struggle with creating realistic demo data

**Tasks**:

**Monday-Wednesday: Research & Interviews**
- [ ] Create interview script (15 questions about demo data pain):
  - How much time do you spend creating demo data per week?
  - What tools do you use? (Faker, Mockaroo, manual SQL?)
  - What's most frustrating about current tools?
  - Have you ever needed industry-specific data (fintech, healthcare)?
  - Would you use a CLI tool? Docker images? Both?
  - What would "perfect" look like?
- [ ] Recruit 20 developers for interviews:
  - 10 backend developers (LinkedIn, r/programming, dev.to)
  - 5 data engineers (LinkedIn, r/dataengineering)
  - 3 sales engineers (LinkedIn, r/salesengineering)
  - 2 DevRel / solutions architects (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Conduct 10 interviews (30-45 min each)

**Thursday-Friday: Synthesis**
- [ ] Analyze interview data:
  - Common pain points (rank by frequency + severity)
  - Current workflows (what tools, how long, what breaks)
  - Must-have vs nice-to-have features
  - CLI vs Docker preference (or both?)
- [ ] Create persona doc:
  - Alex the Backend Dev (building SaaS analytics dashboard)
  - Maria the Data Engineer (testing ETL pipelines)
  - Sam the Sales Engineer (creating customer demos)
- [ ] Draft problem statement (1 page, quantified pain):
  - "Developers spend 5-10 hours/week creating demo data"
  - "Faker is too generic, manual SQL is tedious"
  - "No tool for verticalized, industry-specific data"

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 10 interviews completed
- ✅ Problem statement doc (validated with real data)
- ✅ 3 personas (backend dev, data engineer, SE)

**Success Metric**: 8 out of 10 developers say "Yes, I have this problem and I'd use a tool to fix it"

---

### Week 2: Solution Validation & Pre-Design

**Goal**: Validate CLI + Docker approach, confirm developers would use it

**Tasks**:

**Monday-Tuesday: More Interviews**
- [ ] Conduct 10 more interviews (reach 20 total)
- [ ] Show mockup of CLI usage:
  ```bash
  # Install
  npm install -g sourcebox

  # Seed database
  sourcebox seed mysql --schema=fintech-loans --records=1000

  # Output:
  ✅ Seeded MySQL database 'demo' with 1,000 loan records
  ✅ Time: 15 seconds
  ```
- [ ] Show mockup of Docker usage:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 3306:3306 sourcebox/mysql-fintech:latest
  ```
- [ ] Ask: "Would you use this? Which approach do you prefer?"

**Wednesday-Thursday: Tech Stack Decision**
- [ ] Decide CLI language:
  - Option A: **Rust** (fast, single binary, learning curve)
  - Option B: **Go** (fast, simple, great CLI libs like Cobra)
  - Recommendation: **Go** (faster to ship, great ecosystem)
- [ ] Decide data generation approach:
  - Faker.js + custom logic for verticalization
  - Template system (JSON/YAML schemas)
  - Distribution logic (realistic credit scores, loan amounts)
- [ ] Decide database support:
  - MVP: MySQL + Postgres
  - Future: MongoDB, SQLite, Snowflake

**Friday: Define MVP Scope**
- [ ] Define MVP features:
  - **CLI**: seed command only (no GUI)
  - **Schemas**: 3 industries (fintech, healthcare, retail)
  - **Databases**: 2 types (MySQL, Postgres)
  - **Records**: 100-5,000 per schema
  - **Docker**: Pre-built images for MySQL + Postgres
- [ ] Define out-of-scope (post-MVP):
  - Cloud-hosted databases (Phase 2)
  - Custom schema builder (Phase 3)
  - MongoDB support (Month 4)
  - 50+ schemas (grow over time)
- [ ] Estimate timing:
  - CLI tool: 3 weeks
  - Data generation: 2 weeks
  - Docker images: 1 week
  - Docs: 1 week
  - Testing + launch: 2 weeks

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 20 interviews completed
- ✅ Tech stack decided (Go + Faker + Docker)
- ✅ MVP scope defined (CLI + 3 schemas + Docker)

**Success Metric**: 15 out of 20 developers say "I would use this tool"

**Decision Point**: If <75% validation, STOP and pivot (problem may not be severe enough)

---

## Phase 2: Build Core Product (Weeks 3-8)

### Week 3: CLI Foundation

**Goal**: Get basic CLI working (`sourcebox --version`, `sourcebox --help`)

**Tasks**:

**Monday: Project Setup**
- [ ] Initialize Git repo
- [ ] Create Go project structure:
  ```
  /sourcebox
    /cmd          # CLI commands
    /pkg          # Core logic
      /generators # Data generation
      /schemas    # Schema definitions
      /database   # DB connectors
    /schemas      # JSON/YAML schema files
    /docker       # Dockerfiles
    go.mod
  ```
- [ ] Install Go dependencies:
  - Cobra (CLI framework)
  - go-faker (data generation)
  - database drivers (mysql, postgres)

**Tuesday-Wednesday: CLI Framework**
- [ ] Implement CLI commands (using Cobra):
  - `sourcebox --version` (show version)
  - `sourcebox --help` (show usage)
  - `sourcebox seed` (stub, no logic yet)
  - `sourcebox list-schemas` (show available schemas)
- [ ] Add flags for `seed` command:
  - `--database` (mysql, postgres)
  - `--schema` (fintech-loans, healthcare-patients, retail-ecommerce)
  - `--records` (number of records, default 1000)
  - `--host`, `--port`, `--user`, `--password`, `--db-name`
- [ ] Test: `sourcebox seed --help` shows correct flags

**Thursday: Database Connectors**
- [ ] Implement MySQL connector (`pkg/database/mysql.go`):
  - `Connect(host, port, user, password, dbName)`
  - `CreateTables(schema)`
  - `InsertRecords(table, records)`
  - `Close()`
- [ ] Implement Postgres connector (`pkg/database/postgres.go`):
  - Same interface as MySQL
- [ ] Test: Connect to local MySQL/Postgres, create table, insert 1 row

**Friday: Schema Definition**
- [ ] Define schema format (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "fintech-loans",
    "description": "Loan records for fintech demos",
    "tables": [
      {
        "name": "loans",
        "columns": [
          {"name": "id", "type": "int", "primary_key": true},
          {"name": "amount", "type": "decimal", "generator": "loan_amount"},
          {"name": "rate", "type": "decimal", "generator": "interest_rate"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create first schema: `schemas/fintech-loans.json`
- [ ] Implement schema parser (`pkg/schemas/parser.go`)
- [ ] Test: Load schema from JSON, parse into Go structs

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ CLI framework working (Cobra)
- ✅ Database connectors (MySQL + Postgres)
- ✅ Schema definition format (JSON)

**Success Metric**: `sourcebox seed --database=mysql` connects to DB (no data yet)

---

### Week 4: Data Generation Engine

**Goal**: Generate realistic, verticalized data for fintech schema

**Tasks**:

**Monday-Tuesday: Data Generators**
- [ ] Implement base generators (`pkg/generators/base.go`):

  - `Email()` → realistic emails (not "test@test.com")
  - `Phone()` → valid US phone numbers
  - `Address()` → real addresses (city, state, zip)
  - `Company()` → realistic company names (not "Acme Corp")
- [ ] Implement fintech generators (`pkg/generators/fintech.go`):
  - `LoanAmount()` → $5K-$500K, realistic distribution
  - `InterestRate()` → 3%-15%, weighted toward prime rates
  - `CreditScore()` → 300-850, bell curve around 680
  - `LoanStatus()` → "active", "paid", "delinquent" (weighted)
  - `PaymentHistory()` → realistic payment dates + amounts
- [ ] Test: Generate 100 loans, verify distribution looks realistic

**Wednesday: Relationships & Integrity**
- [ ] Implement foreign key logic:
  - Generate borrowers first
  - Generate loans linked to borrowers
  - Generate payments linked to loans
- [ ] Implement data integrity:
  - Email unique constraint
  - Phone number format validation
  - Credit score range (300-850)
  - Loan amount > 0
- [ ] Test: Generate 1,000 records, verify FK relationships intact

**Thursday: Seed Command Implementation**

  1. Parse flags (database, schema, records)
  2. Load schema from JSON
  3. Connect to database
  4. Create tables (if not exist)
  5. Generate data (use generators)
  6. Insert records (batch inserts for speed)
  7. Show progress bar (using progress lib)
  8. Display summary (time, records inserted)
- [ ] Test: `sourcebox seed mysql --schema=fintech-loans --records=1000`
  - Should complete in < 30 seconds
  - Should insert 1,000 loan records

**Friday: Error Handling & Logging**
- [ ] Add error handling:
  - Database connection failed → clear error message
  - Schema not found → list available schemas
  - Invalid flag values → show usage
- [ ] Add logging (using logrus):
  - Info: "Connecting to MySQL..."
  - Debug: "Generated 1000 loans"
  - Error: "Failed to insert records: [details]"
- [ ] Test: Trigger errors, verify messages are helpful

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Data generation engine (realistic fintech data)
- ✅ `seed` command working (MySQL + fintech schema)
- ✅ Progress bar + summary output

**Success Metric**: Seed 1,000 fintech loans in < 30 seconds with realistic data

  **Hacker News "Show HN"**:
  ```
  Show HN: SourceBox - Realistic demo data for developers (CLI + Docker)

  I'm a solutions architect, and I was frustrated with how long it takes to create realistic demo data. Faker is too generic ("John Doe", "Acme Corp"), and manual SQL is tedious.

  So I built SourceBox - a CLI tool and Docker images with verticalized, realistic data for fintech, healthcare, retail, and more.

  Examples:
  - CLI: `sourcebox seed mysql --schema=fintech-loans --records=1000` (30 seconds)
  - Docker: `docker run sourcebox/mysql-fintech` (10 seconds)

  Open source (MIT), free forever. Cloud version (freemium) coming in Phase 2.

  Would love your feedback! GitHub: [link]
  ```

  **Reddit r/programming**:
  ```
  I built a tool for spinning up databases with realistic demo data

  TL;DR: CLI tool + Docker images with verticalized data (fintech, healthcare, retail). Open source, free forever.

  The Problem:
  Creating realistic demo data takes 5-10 hours per week. Faker gives you "John Doe", manual SQL is tedious, and production dumps are a security nightmare.

  The Solution:
  SourceBox provides verticalized schemas - fintech data looks like fintech (loan amounts, credit scores), healthcare looks like healthcare (diagnoses, prescriptions), etc.

  Quick Start:
  - `npm install -g sourcebox`
  - `sourcebox seed mysql --schema=fintech-loans --records=1000`
  - Done in 30 seconds

  Or use Docker:
  - `docker run sourcebox/mysql-fintech`
  - Database ready in 10 seconds

  Tech Stack: Go (CLI), Docker, MySQL/Postgres, Faker + custom generators

  Open source (MIT): [GitHub link]
  Docs: [docs site]

  Would love your feedback!
  ```

  **LinkedIn Personal Post**:
  ```
  After 2 years as a solutions architect, I got tired of spending hours creating demo data for customer presentations.

  So I built SourceBox - a CLI tool and Docker images that give you realistic, industry-specific demo data in 30 seconds.

  No more "John Doe" or "Acme Corp". Fintech data looks like fintech. Healthcare looks like healthcare.

  Open source, free forever. MIT license.

## Risk Mitigation

**Key Risks During MVP**:

1. **Can't validate problem (Week 2)**
   - Mitigation: Interview 20 developers (not just 10), diverse backgrounds
   - Fallback: If <75% validation, pivot to different problem or persona

2. **CLI tool too slow (Week 4)**
   - Mitigation: Batch inserts, parallel processing, optimize generators
   - Fallback: Accept 60s for MVP (not 30s), optimize post-launch

3. **Docker images too large (Week 6)**
   - Mitigation: Compress seed data, use multi-stage builds, alpine base images
   - Fallback: Accept 500MB images for MVP, optimize post-launch

4. **No alpha testers (Week 11)**
   - Mitigation: Reach out to 20 developers from Week 1-2 interviews
   - Fallback: Launch without alpha testing (riskier, but acceptable)

5. **Launch flops (Week 12)**
   - Mitigation: Seed with 20 developers from interviews, guaranteed engagement
   - Fallback: Iterate on messaging, try different channels (Twitter, ProductHunt)
