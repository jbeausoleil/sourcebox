# ========================================
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
# ========================================

overview:
  name: SourceBox
  tagline: "Realistic, verticalized demo data for developers - spin up production-like databases in 30 seconds"
  mission: "Provide developers with instant access to realistic, verticalized demo data through CLI tools and Docker images"

  core_problem:
    description: "Developers waste 5-10 hours/week creating realistic demo data"
    key_pain_points:
      - generic_faker: "Faker is too generic ('John Doe', 'Acme Corp') - looks unprofessional"
      - manual_sql: "Writing 1,000+ INSERT statements is tedious and time-consuming"
      - production_dumps: "Using production data is a security/compliance nightmare (PII, GDPR, HIPAA)"
      - no_verticalization: "No existing tool provides verticalized data (fintech looks like fintech, not 'Employee 123')"

  solution:
    description: "CLI tool + Docker images with verticalized, realistic demo data"
    key_features:
      - "CLI: `sourcebox seed mysql --schema=fintech-loans --records=1000` (30 seconds)"
      - "Docker: `docker run sourcebox/mysql-fintech` (10 seconds)"
      - "Verticalized schemas: Fintech, healthcare, retail, SaaS, e-commerce, logistics"
      - "Realistic distributions: Proper bell curves, relationships, edge cases"
      - "Multiple databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (Phase 2)"
      - "Open source: MIT license, free forever"

  success_metrics:
    north_star: "Weekly active developers using SourceBox (target: 10,000+ by Month 12)"
    phase_1_targets_month_6:
      - "1,000 GitHub stars"
      - "10,000 Docker Hub pulls"
      - "100 daily CLI installs (npm + homebrew)"
      - "NPS 50+ (strong product/market fit)"
    phase_2_targets_month_12:
      - "$10K MRR (cloud version: freemium SaaS)"
      - "1,000 paying users"
      - "5% free → paid conversion"

# ========================================
# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
# ========================================

architecture:
  style: modular_cli
  deployment: local_first_cloud_optional
  distribution: open_source

  high_level_components:
    - cli_tool: "Go + Cobra framework (commands: seed, list-schemas, version, help)"
    - data_generation_engine: "Faker + custom logic for verticalized distributions"
    - schema_definitions: "JSON/YAML templates (fintech, healthcare, retail)"
    - database_connectors: "MySQL, PostgreSQL drivers (MongoDB in Phase 2)"
    - docker_images: "Pre-seeded databases on Docker Hub"
    - documentation_site: "Docusaurus (examples, CLI reference, schema library)"

  data_flow_cli:
    - step_1: "Developer runs `sourcebox seed mysql --schema=fintech-loans --records=1000`"
    - step_2: "CLI validates inputs (schema exists, DB connection works)"
    - step_3: "CLI loads schema definition (fintech-loans.json)"
    - step_4: "Data generation engine creates realistic records (loans, borrowers, payments)"
    - step_5: "CLI inserts data into MySQL (batched INSERTs, progress bar)"
    - step_6: "CLI reports success (tables created, record counts, time elapsed)"

  data_flow_docker:
    - step_1: "Developer runs `docker run -p 3306:3306 sourcebox/mysql-fintech`"
    - step_2: "Docker pulls image from Docker Hub (or uses cached)"
    - step_3: "Container starts MySQL with pre-seeded fintech data"
    - step_4: "Developer connects: `mysql -h localhost -u root -p demo`"
    - step_5: "Data is immediately available (no seeding time)"

# ========================================
# TECH STACK
# ========================================

tech_stack:
  philosophy: "Boring tech wins - proven > shiny"

  cli_tool:
    language: Go 1.21+
    framework: Cobra (CLI framework, used by kubectl, GitHub CLI)
    libraries:
      - go_faker: "github.com/bxcodec/faker (base for data generation)"
      - mysql_driver: "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
      - postgres_driver: "github.com/lib/pq"
      - viper: "github.com/spf13/viper (config management)"
      - progressbar: "github.com/schollz/progressbar (CLI progress)"

    rationale:
      - "Go: Fast, single binary, cross-platform (Mac, Linux, Windows)"
      - "Cobra: Standard for CLI tools, great UX, easy to extend"
      - "Single binary: No dependencies, easy install (vs Python + pip)"

    distribution:
      - npm: "npm install -g sourcebox (JavaScript developers)"
      - homebrew: "brew install sourcebox (Mac developers)"
      - apt_deb: "apt install sourcebox (Linux developers)"
      - binary_download: "GitHub Releases (Windows, direct download)"
      - docker: "docker run sourcebox/cli (containerized)"

  data_generation:
    core_library: go-faker (base random data)
    custom_generators:
      - fintech: "LoanAmount, InterestRate, CreditScore, LoanStatus"
      - healthcare: "Diagnosis, Prescription, InsuranceProvider, ClaimAmount"
      - retail: "ProductPrice, InventoryCount, OrderStatus, CustomerSegment"

    distribution_logic:
      - credit_scores: "Bell curve (mean=680, std=80, range=300-850)"
      - loan_amounts: "Log-normal (median=$50K, skewed right, max=$500K)"
      - interest_rates: "Weighted (3%-6% = 60%, 6%-10% = 30%, 10%-15% = 10%)"
      - loan_status: "Weighted (active=70%, paid=25%, delinquent=5%)"

    rationale:
      - "Faker: Good baseline (names, emails, addresses)"
      - "Custom logic: Verticalization (fintech looks like fintech, not 'Acme Corp')"
      - "Proper distributions: Realistic (bell curves, weighted, log-normal)"

  schema_definitions:
    format: JSON (machine-readable, easy to parse)
    location: "cli/schemas/*.json"

    structure:
      - metadata: "name, description, version, industry"
      - tables: "array of table definitions"
      - columns: "name, type, generator, constraints"
      - relationships: "foreign keys, references"

    example_fintech_schema:
      name: "fintech-loans"
      description: "Loan records for fintech demos"
      version: "1.0.0"
      tables:
        - name: "borrowers"
          columns:
            - {name: "id", type: "int", primary_key: true, auto_increment: true}
            - {name: "name", type: "varchar(100)", generator: "name"}
            - {name: "email", type: "varchar(100)", generator: "email"}
            - {name: "credit_score", type: "int", generator: "credit_score"}
            - {name: "created_at", type: "timestamp", generator: "timestamp"}
        - name: "loans"
          columns:
            - {name: "id", type: "int", primary_key: true, auto_increment: true}
            - {name: "borrower_id", type: "int", foreign_key: "borrowers.id"}
            - {name: "amount", type: "decimal(10,2)", generator: "loan_amount"}
            - {name: "interest_rate", type: "decimal(5,2)", generator: "interest_rate"}
            - {name: "status", type: "varchar(20)", generator: "loan_status"}
            - {name: "created_at", type: "timestamp", generator: "timestamp"}

    rationale:
      - "JSON: Easy to parse, machine-readable, extensible"
      - "Schema-driven: Add new schemas without changing CLI code"
      - "Community-friendly: Easy for contributors to add schemas"

  docker_images:
    base_images:
      - mysql: "mysql:8.0"
      - postgres: "postgres:16"
      - mongo: "mongo:7 (Phase 2)"

    custom_images:

      - sourcebox_mysql_healthcare: "MySQL + healthcare seed data"
      - sourcebox_mysql_retail: "MySQL + retail seed data"
      - sourcebox_postgres_fintech: "PostgreSQL + fintech seed data"
      - sourcebox_postgres_healthcare: "PostgreSQL + healthcare seed data"
      - sourcebox_postgres_retail: "PostgreSQL + retail seed data"

    dockerfile_approach:
      - step_1: "FROM mysql:8.0"
      - step_2: "COPY seed-fintech.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/"
      - step_3: "ENV MYSQL_DATABASE=demo MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password"
      - step_4: "MySQL auto-runs seed script on first start"

    distribution:
      - docker_hub: "hub.docker.com/u/sourcebox"
      - github_packages: "ghcr.io/yourusername/sourcebox"

    rationale:
      - "Docker Hub: Standard for developers, free hosting"
      - "Pre-seeded: 10-second spin-up (vs 30s for CLI seeding)"
      - "Portable: Works anywhere Docker runs (local, CI/CD, cloud)"

  documentation:
    site_generator: Docusaurus 3
    hosting: Vercel (free for open source)
    url: "docs.sourcebox.dev"

    structure:
      - introduction: "What is SourceBox, quick start"
      - installation: "npm, homebrew, binary download"
      - cli_reference: "Commands, flags, examples"
      - schema_library: "All schemas (fintech, healthcare, retail)"
      - docker_images: "Docker Hub images, docker-compose examples"
      - custom_schemas: "How to create custom schemas (JSON format)"
      - contributing: "How to contribute schemas, report bugs"

    rationale:
      - "Docusaurus: Standard for dev tools (React, Tailwind, Vercel, etc.)"
      - "Vercel: Free, fast, auto-deploy on git push"

  testing:
    unit: "Go testing package (test data generation logic)"
    integration: "Testcontainers (real MySQL/Postgres in Docker)"
    cli_e2e: "Shell scripts (test CLI commands end-to-end)"
    docker_e2e: "docker-compose tests (test images work)"

    rationale:
      - "Go testing: Built-in, fast, good enough"
      - "Testcontainers: Real databases, catch more bugs"

  observability_phase_1:
    github_stars: "Track via GitHub API"
    docker_pulls: "Track via Docker Hub API"
    npm_installs: "Track via npm API"
    errors: "None (local CLI, no telemetry)"

    rationale:
      - "Open source: No telemetry (privacy-first)"
      - "Public metrics: GitHub stars, Docker pulls (validate traction)"

  observability_phase_2_cloud:
    uptime: "Uptime Robot (cloud-hosted databases)"
    apm: "Datadog APM"
    errors: "Sentry"
    logs: "Datadog logs"
    metrics: "Custom (usage, API calls)"

    rationale:
      - "Cloud version: Need observability (customers pay for uptime)"

# ========================================
# BUILD VS BUY DECISIONS
# ========================================

build_vs_buy:
  philosophy: "Buy if commodity, build if differentiator"

  decisions:

    - component: "CLI Framework"
      decision: BUY (Cobra)
      rationale:
        - "Cobra is standard (kubectl, GitHub CLI, Hugo)"
        - "Great UX, easy to extend, battle-tested"
        - "Free, open source, MIT license"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "urfave/cli: Less popular, worse docs"
        - "Build custom: Reinventing wheel, bad UX"

    - component: "Data Generation"
      decision: BUILD (custom generators on top of Faker)
      rationale:
        - "Core differentiator (verticalized, not generic)"
        - "Faker is baseline (names, emails), we add industry logic"
        - "Must control distributions (bell curves, weighted, log-normal)"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Use Faker only: Too generic, not verticalized"
        - "Mockaroo API: Web-based, not local, $60/mo"

    - component: "Schema Definitions"
      decision: BUILD (JSON format)
      rationale:
        - "Core product (differentiator)"
        - "Simple JSON format (easy for contributors)"
        - "Schema-driven (add new schemas without changing CLI code)"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "YAML: More verbose, harder to parse"
        - "Code-based (Go structs): Harder for contributors"

    - component: "Database Drivers"
      decision: BUY (go-sql-driver/mysql, lib/pq)
      rationale:
        - "Standard Go drivers (battle-tested)"
        - "Free, open source, well-maintained"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Build custom: Reinventing wheel, bugs, no benefit"

    - component: "Docker Images"
      decision: BUILD (custom Dockerfiles with seed data)
      rationale:
        - "Core product (differentiator)"
        - "Must pre-seed data (10-second spin-up vs 30s CLI seeding)"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Use official MySQL/Postgres only: No pre-seeding, manual setup"

    - component: "Documentation Site"
      decision: BUY (Docusaurus)
      rationale:
        - "Docusaurus is standard for dev tools"
        - "Free, open source, Vercel hosting"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Jekyll: Older, Ruby-based"
        - "Custom: Too much work, bad UX"

    - component: "Testing"
      decision: BUY (Go testing, Testcontainers)
      rationale:
        - "Go testing is built-in, good enough"
        - "Testcontainers: Real databases, catch more bugs"
      alternatives_considered:
        - "Build custom: Reinventing wheel"

# ========================================
# TECHNICAL DEBT STRATEGY
# ========================================

technical_debt:
  philosophy: "Debt is OK if it gets us to validation faster - pay down after adoption"

  acceptable_debt_mvp:
    - "No MongoDB support (MySQL + Postgres only)"
    - "No CI/CD releases (manual GitHub Releases)"
    - "No Windows installer (binary download only)"
    - "No schema validation (trust JSON is correct)"
    - "No error recovery (if seed fails, user re-runs)"
    - "No usage analytics (no telemetry)"
    - "No homebrew-core submission (homebrew tap only)"

  pay_down_after_validation:
    - month_4: "Add MongoDB support (3rd database)"
    - month_6: "Add CI/CD releases (GoReleaser, auto-build binaries)"
    - month_6: "Add Windows installer (MSI or exe)"
    - month_9: "Add schema validation (JSON schema validation)"
    - month_12: "Add error recovery (auto-retry, resume from checkpoint)"

  red_flags_never_ship:
    - "SQL injection vulnerabilities (use prepared statements from day 1)"
    - "No progress bars (users will think CLI is frozen)"
    - "No error messages (users won't know what went wrong)"
    - "Hardcoded credentials (use env vars or flags)"
    - "Proprietary license (must be MIT from day 1)"

# ========================================
# RISKS & MITIGATIONS
# ========================================

risks_and_mitigations:

  - risk: "30s seeding target not achievable (users won't use if slow)"
    impact: HIGH (core promise)
    probability: LOW
    mitigation:
      - "Batched inserts (100 records per batch, not 1)"
      - "Prepared statements (avoid SQL injection + faster)"
      - "Parallel table seeding (seed tables in parallel)"
      - "Fallback: Accept 60s for MVP, optimize later"

  - risk: "Data not realistic enough (users won't trust it)"
    impact: MEDIUM (credibility)
    probability: LOW
    mitigation:
      - "User testing with 10 developers (validate realism)"
      - "Proper distributions (bell curves, weighted, log-normal)"
      - "Industry-specific values (not 'John Doe' or 'Acme Corp')"

  - risk: "Schema complexity (every industry is different)"
    impact: MEDIUM (can't scale to 50+ schemas)
    probability: LOW
    mitigation:
      - "Start with 3 schemas (fintech, healthcare, retail)"
      - "JSON format (easy for contributors)"
      - "Community-driven (accept pull requests for new schemas)"

  - risk: "Docker Hub size limits (200 MB free tier)"
    impact: LOW (can't publish all images)
    probability: MEDIUM
    mitigation:
      - "Optimize image sizes (compress seed data, multi-stage builds)"
      - "Host on GitHub Packages (unlimited for public repos)"
      - "Upgrade to Docker Hub Pro ($5/mo) if needed"

  - risk: "Go learning curve (founder not expert in Go)"
    impact: MEDIUM (slower development)
    probability: MEDIUM
    mitigation:
      - "Go is simple (easier than Rust)"
      - "Lots of tutorials, documentation, community"
      - "Hire freelance Go dev ($50-100/hr) if stuck"

  - risk: "Legal/IP issues (employment constraints)"
    impact: HIGH (company-ending)
    probability: LOW
    mitigation:
      - "Independent development only (personal equipment, outside work hours)"
      - "No employer resources or proprietary information"
      - "Open source (MIT license, full transparency)"
      - "No employer references in documentation"

# ========================================
# DECISION LOG
# ========================================

decision_log:
  description: "Key technical decisions and rationale"

  - date: "2025-01-14"
    decision: "Use Go instead of Rust for CLI"
    rationale:
      - "Go: Simpler, faster compile, easier to hire for"
      - "Single binary: Same benefit as Rust"
      - "Cross-platform: Same as Rust (Mac, Linux, Windows)"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Rust: Steeper learning curve, slower compile, harder to hire"
      - "Python: Requires runtime, slower, not single binary"

  - date: "2025-01-14"
    decision: "Use Cobra instead of urfave/cli"
    rationale:
      - "Cobra: Standard (kubectl, GitHub CLI, Hugo)"
      - "Great UX: Help, autocomplete, subcommands"
      - "Better docs: More tutorials, examples"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "urfave/cli: Less popular, worse docs"
      - "Build custom: Reinventing wheel, bad UX"

  - date: "2025-01-14"
    decision: "Start with CLI + Docker, not web UI"
    rationale:
      - "Developers prefer CLI (fits workflow)"
      - "Docker: Standard for developers (already installed)"
      - "Web UI: More complex, slower to build, less developer-friendly"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Web UI first: SE-focused, not developer-focused"
      - "API-only: No UX, users would need to build own CLI"

  - date: "2025-01-14"
    decision: "Use JSON for schemas, not YAML or code"
    rationale:
      - "JSON: Machine-readable, easy to parse, standard"
      - "Simpler than YAML: No indentation issues"
      - "Easier for contributors than code (Go structs)"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "YAML: More verbose, indentation issues"
      - "Go structs: Harder for non-Go contributors"

  - date: "2025-01-14"
    decision: "Open source first (MIT), not proprietary"
    rationale:
      - "Build trust: Users can audit code"
      - "Validate market: Free adoption, then monetize cloud version"
      - "Community-driven: Accept contributions (schemas, bug fixes)"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Proprietary: Lower trust, slower adoption, no community"
      - "GPL: Too restrictive, limits commercial use"

  - date: "2025-01-14"
    decision: "Start with MySQL + Postgres, not MongoDB"
    rationale:
      - "MySQL + Postgres: Most common (80% of developers)"
      - "SQL: Easier to seed (batched INSERTs)"
      - "MongoDB: NoSQL, different paradigm (Phase 2)"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "MongoDB first: Less demand, harder to seed"
      - "All 3 at once: Too slow, risky"
