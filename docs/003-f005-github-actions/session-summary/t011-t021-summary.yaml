key_decisions:
  - decision: "Enable fail-fast: false"
    rationale: "Critical for infrastructure CI to see all platform failures, not just first failure"
    impact: "Complete visibility into cross-platform compatibility issues at cost of longer failed runs"

  - decision: "Comprehensive quickstart.md documentation"
    rationale: "PR workflow and branch protection are complex GitHub features requiring detailed guidance"
    impact: "1,341-line guide enables developers to independently verify and troubleshoot CI/CD issues"

  - decision: "Race detector on all platforms"
    rationale: "Data races can be platform-specific due to scheduler differences"
    impact: "Higher confidence in concurrent code correctness, minimal execution time penalty (~10%)"

  - decision: "Document 4 failure scenarios with fixes"
    rationale: "Enable self-service debugging for common CI failures"
    impact: "Reduces need for senior developer intervention on common issues"
