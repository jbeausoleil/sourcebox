key_decisions:
  - decision: "Single quotes for Windows coverage flag"
    rationale: "PowerShell parsing treats -coverprofile=coverage.txt incorrectly, splitting on dot and interpreting .txt as package name"
    impact: "Fixed critical Windows test failures (2 of 6 matrix jobs)"

  - decision: "fail_ci_if_error: false for Codecov"
    rationale: "Prevent CI blocking if Codecov service has temporary issues"
    impact: "More reliable CI pipeline, coverage tracking remains optional"

  - decision: "Separate lint job on ubuntu-latest only"
    rationale: "Linting is platform-agnostic, running on all 6 platforms wastes resources"
    impact: "Faster CI execution, same quality enforcement"

  - decision: "Go module caching with go.sum hash key"
    rationale: "Standard GitHub Actions pattern for Go dependency caching"
    impact: "Sub-5-second cache restoration, workflow well under 5-minute target"

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority: []

  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Codecov service dependency"
      impact: "Coverage tracking unavailable if Codecov experiences outages"
      solution: "Already mitigated with fail_ci_if_error: false"
      estimate: "0 hours (already handled)"

    - issue: "golangci-lint version updates may introduce new rules"
      impact: "CI may start failing on previously passing code after linter update"
      solution: "Pin golangci-lint version or review updates quarterly"
      estimate: "1 hour quarterly"

  low_priority:
    - issue: "Cache strategy may need adjustment as dependencies grow"
      impact: "Cache size or hit rate could degrade with many dependencies"
      solution: "Monitor cache performance and adjust path/key strategy if needed"
      estimate: "2 hours if needed"
