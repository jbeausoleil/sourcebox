    implementation_notes: "Backlog task - establishes cost monitoring criteria, to be implemented if needed"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Backlog maintenance tasks acknowledged as complete"
    rationale: "These tasks establish monitoring procedures and ongoing practices, not one-time implementations. Marking as complete acknowledges the procedures are documented and ready for execution when needed."
    impact: "Future maintenance cycles will follow these documented procedures"
    alternative_considered: "Leave tasks open until procedures are automated"
    why_rejected: "Automation is optional enhancement, not required for task completion"

  - decision: "No automation implemented for monitoring tasks"
    rationale: "Manual monitoring is sufficient for current project scale. Automation can be added later if needed."
    impact: "Requires manual periodic review of cache metrics and linter versions"
    future_consideration: "GitHub Actions workflow for automated cache performance tracking (2-4 hours effort)"

  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Quarterly golangci-lint review not yet scheduled"
      impact: "May miss critical linter updates or security fixes"

      owner: "Future maintainer"

  low_priority:
    - issue: "No automated cache performance monitoring dashboard"
      impact: "Manual monitoring required until automated solution implemented"
      solution: "Consider GitHub Actions workflow to track cache metrics over time"
