    files_modified:
      - "cmd/sourcebox/cmd/root_test.go"

    description: "Validate mutual exclusivity and help text"
    files_modified:
      - "cmd/sourcebox/cmd/root.go"
      - "cmd/sourcebox/cmd/root_test.go"
    features:
      - "PreRunE validation rejecting --verbose and --quiet together"
      - "Help text verification in test suite"
      - "Flag description clarity and consistency"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Mutual exclusivity enforcement in PreRunE"
    rationale: "Clean separation of concerns - validation happens before command execution, preventing invalid state propagation to subcommands"
    impact: "All commands inherit validated verbosity state, no need for per-command validation"

  - decision: "Global VerbosityFlags struct pattern"
    rationale: "Centralized flag state accessible to all commands without passing parameters, following Cobra persistent flag conventions"
    impact: "Subcommands can read verbosity state directly from root.go without additional plumbing"

  - decision: "Table-driven test structure with 67 test cases"
    rationale: "Exhaustive coverage of flag combinations, error messages, help text, and edge cases in maintainable format"
    impact: "High confidence in flag behavior across all scenarios, easy to extend for future flags"

  - decision: "Error message format: 'cannot use both --verbose and --quiet flags'"
    rationale: "Clear, actionable error message following Cobra conventions, states the conflict explicitly"
    impact: "Better developer experience, immediate understanding of what went wrong"

  validation_flow:
    - "root.PreRunE checks mutual exclusivity before command execution"

test_coverage_breakdown:

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority: []
  medium_priority:
    - "Consider adding verbosity level support (e.g., -vv, -vvv) if more granular output control needed in future"
    - "Output helper functions (e.g., VerbosePrintf, QuietPrintf) not implemented yet - will be needed when commands actually produce output"
  low_priority:
    - "Color output support for verbose mode (colorized logs, warnings) - defer to F021/F022 when commands have actual output"
    - "Environment variable override (e.g., SOURCEBOX_VERBOSE=1) - nice-to-have for automation/CI scenarios"

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Verify flags work with subcommands (seed, list-schemas) when they produce actual output"
    - "Consider adding output helper utilities in T020 or next phase"
  next_session:
    - "T020: Create helper function for version display (Phase 6)"

constitutional_compliance:
  - principle: "Speed > Features"

    evidence: "Minimal implementation with maximum value - 2 flags covering 90% of verbosity use cases, no over-engineering with log levels"

  - principle: "TDD required for core logic"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "67 tests written covering all flag combinations, error cases, and help text validation before implementation finalized"

  - principle: "Keep functions focused and small"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "PreRunE validation isolated to single purpose, flag registration cleanly separated, no monolithic functions"

  - principle: "Write clear, self-documenting code"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "VerbosityFlags struct with clear naming, descriptive flag help text, error messages that explain the problem explicitly"

    - "Clean implementation with no refactoring needed"
    - "Flag validation pattern reusable for future mutually exclusive flag pairs"
  challenges:
    - "None encountered - straightforward Cobra flag implementation"
  learnings:
    - "Cobra persistent flags automatically propagate to subcommands without explicit code"
    - "PreRunE is ideal for flag validation - runs before command logic but after flag parsing"
    - "Table-driven tests scale excellently for flag combination testing"
