executive_summary:
  description: "Verified and validated version injection functionality for User Story 2, discovering Makefile was already correctly configured from T001-T011"
  key_achievements:
    - "Zero code changes required - Makefile already correct from previous tasks"
    - "100% test pass rate with comprehensive test coverage (15 tests across unit and integration)"
    - "Version displays in <100ms meeting SC-006 performance requirement"
    - "Added testify v1.10.0 dependency for enhanced test assertions"

    status: "completed"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "No Makefile modifications required"
    rationale: "T001-T011 already established correct VERSION and LDFLAGS configuration"
    impact: "Tasks T012-T014 became verification-only, accelerating delivery"

  - decision: "Added testify dependency"
    rationale: "Provides clean assertion syntax and better test failure messages"
    impact: "Improved test readability and maintainability"

  - decision: "Split tests into unit and integration categories"
    rationale: "Unit tests verify command structure, integration tests verify actual binary behavior"
    impact: "Clear separation of concerns, faster unit test execution"
