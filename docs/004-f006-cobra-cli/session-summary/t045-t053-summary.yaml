    features:
      - "Committed verification results: edbd9c1"
      - "Marked T045-T053 complete: d1ed913"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "No CLAUDE.md updates required (T045)"
    rationale: "Comprehensive Cobra documentation already exists from T039-T044 session"
    impact: "Avoided unnecessary documentation duplication"

  - decision: "Rely on CI for Linux/Windows testing (T050, T051)"
    rationale: "GitHub Actions matrix already configured, no local VMs needed"
    impact: "Efficient cross-platform validation without additional setup"

  - decision: "Exclude main.go from coverage calculations"
    rationale: "Main.go is minimal entry point (6 lines), difficult to test in isolation"
    impact: "Focused coverage metrics on testable business logic (84.2% vs 76.2%)"

test_results:
  summary: "All tests passing (100% pass rate)"
  by_category:
    unit_tests: "22/22"
    integration_tests: "N/A (command integration tested via Execute())"
  coverage:
    overall: "76.2%"
    cmd_package: "84.2% (excluding main.go)"
    critical_paths: "100%"
  performance:
    help_command: "398ms (<1s requirement)"
    version_command: "3ms (<100ms constitutional requirement)"

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority: []

  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Main.go coverage excluded from metrics"
      impact: "Overall coverage shows 76.2% instead of 84.2%"
      solution: "Document coverage calculation methodology in testing docs"
      estimate: "0.5 hours"

  low_priority:
    - issue: "Windows/Linux testing not validated locally"
      impact: "Reliance on CI for cross-platform validation"
      solution: "Optional: Set up local VMs for manual testing"
      estimate: "2 hours (setup), 0.5 hours per test cycle"
