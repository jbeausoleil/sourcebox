executive_summary:
  description: "Completed Phase 1 setup tasks for schema JSON format specification feature"
  key_achievements:
    - "Verified schemas/ directory structure exists at repository root"
    - "Confirmed CLAUDE.md contains Schema JSON Format section with comprehensive documentation"
    - "Validated project readiness for Phase 3 (User Story 1) implementation"

tasks_completed:
  - task_id: "T001"
    description: "Create schemas/ directory at repository root if it doesn't exist"
    files_modified:
      - "(no files modified - directory already existed from planning phase)"
    features:
      - "Verified directory structure exists at /Users/jbeausoleil/Projects/03_projects/personal/sourcebox/schemas/"
      - "Directory ready for schema specification files (schema-spec.md, example-schema.json)"

  - task_id: "T002"
    description: "Verify CLAUDE.md exists and is ready for updates"
    files_modified:
      - "(no files modified - verification only)"
    features:
      - "Confirmed CLAUDE.md contains comprehensive Schema JSON Format section (lines 144-277)"
      - "Verified documentation includes: overview, schema structure, generator types, distribution types, foreign key relationships, versioning strategy, validation rules, Tier 1 targets, supported data types"
      - "Confirmed Recent Changes section documents F007 completion with 6 changelog entries"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Use existing schemas/ directory without modification"
    rationale: "Directory already exists from planning phase, no structural changes needed"
    impact: "Zero overhead, immediate readiness for specification files"
    risk_level: "none"

  - decision: "Leverage comprehensive CLAUDE.md Schema JSON Format section"
    rationale: "CLAUDE.md already contains detailed F007 documentation from planning phase (lines 144-277)"
    impact: "No CLAUDE.md updates required until Phase 10 (polish), accelerates implementation timeline"
    risk_level: "none"
