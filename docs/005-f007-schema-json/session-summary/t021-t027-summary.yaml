    description: "Add validation error message guidance for F008"
    files_modified:
      - "schemas/schema-spec.md"
    features:
      - "Error message format guidelines"
      - "Context-rich error messages (line numbers, field names)"
      - "Actionable fix suggestions"
      - "Severity levels (error vs warning)"
      - "Example error messages for each validation rule category"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Strict validation over permissive"
    rationale: "Catch schema errors at validation time rather than generation runtime - better developer experience"
    impact: "F008 parser must implement all validation rules before accepting schemas"

  - decision: "Dual foreign key representation remains"
    rationale: "Inline for code parsing, explicit for human documentation - both validated independently"
    impact: "Validation must check consistency between inline and explicit representations"

  - decision: "Generation order is mandatory"
    rationale: "Explicit ordering prevents ambiguous dependency resolution and ensures reproducible data generation"
    impact: "Schema authors must specify generation_order array with all tables in dependency order"

  - decision: "Self-referencing foreign keys allowed"
    rationale: "Valid use case (e.g., employee.manager_id → employee.id), common in hierarchical data"
    impact: "Validation must detect circular dependencies between tables, not within tables"

  - decision: "Error messages include fix suggestions"
    rationale: "Self-service schema authoring requires actionable error guidance, not just error detection"
    impact: "F008 parser should provide suggestions like 'Add borrowers to generation_order before loans'"

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority: []
  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Validation rule implementation complexity in F008"
      impact: "F008 parser must implement 30+ validation rules across 5 categories - significant implementation effort"
      solution: "Provide validation rule test suite in F008 (use example-schema.json as valid case, create invalid-schemas/ for error cases)"
      estimate: "4 hours for F008 validation implementation"

    - issue: "No validation for generator parameter types"
      impact: "Schema can specify {min: 'foo', max: 'bar'} for int_range generator and pass validation"
      solution: "Add parameter type validation in T033 (generator_params structure documentation)"
      estimate: "1 hour"

  low_priority:
    - issue: "No foreign key cycle detection algorithm documented"
      impact: "F008 implementers must devise own cycle detection approach"
      solution: "Add algorithm pseudocode in schema-spec.md (topological sort or DFS)"
      estimate: "1 hour"

    - issue: "No validation for index column existence"
      impact: "Schema can define index on non-existent column and pass validation"
      solution: "Add to column-level validation rules: 'Indexed columns must exist in table'"
      estimate: "30 minutes"

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Review schema-spec.md section 7 (Validation Rules) for completeness"
    - "Verify all edge cases from T026 are actionable for F008 implementers"

  next_session:
    - "T028: Document built-in personal data generators (first_name, last_name, email, etc.)"
    - "T029: Document built-in company data generators (company_name, job_title, etc.)"
    - "T030: Document built-in date/time generators (timestamp_past, timestamp_future, etc.)"
    - "T031: Document built-in numeric generators (int_range, float_range, decimal_range)"

    evidence: "Validation rules enforce record_count constraints, enabling validation of <5,000 record limit per constitution"

  - principle: "Boring Technology"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "JSON schema format with standard SQL validation rules - no exotic dependencies or novel approaches"

  - principle: "Open Source Forever (MIT)"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "Schema format specification is documentation - no proprietary formats or licensing restrictions"

  - principle: "Implementable by F008"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "All validation rules are implementable with standard Go JSON parsing and validation logic - no ambiguous requirements"
