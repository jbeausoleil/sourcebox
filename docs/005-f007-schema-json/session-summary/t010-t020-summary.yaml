key_decisions:
  - decision: "Use fintech vertical for example schema"
    rationale: "Demonstrates realistic, verticalized data (Core Principle I). Loan/borrower/payment relationships are familiar to developers and demonstrate complex foreign key patterns."
    impact: "Sets quality bar for future schema contributions. Shows verticalized > generic."
  - decision: "Demonstrate all 4 distribution types"
    rationale: "Example must be comprehensive reference for schema authors. Each distribution type serves specific use cases (normal for credit scores, lognormal for loan amounts, weighted for categorical data, ranges for tiered values)."
    impact: "Schema authors can copy/modify example patterns. Reduces need for separate distribution documentation."
  - decision: "Use dual foreign key representation (inline + explicit)"
    rationale: "Inline format is what parser uses (code-first). Explicit format is documentation for humans. Dual representation serves both needs."
    impact: "F008 parser can use inline definitions. Documentation consumers get explicit relationships section."
  - decision: "Target 4,950 records (under 5,000 Tier 1 limit)"
    rationale: "Constitutional constraint: Tier 1 schemas must generate in <30 seconds. Staying under 5,000 ensures MVP compliance."
    impact: "Example demonstrates Tier 1 complexity. Higher complexity requires Tier 2/3 justification."

test_results:
  summary: "JSON syntax validation passed"
  by_category:
    json_validation: "pass (jq parsing successful)"
    tier_1_compliance: "pass (4,950 < 5,000 records)"
  coverage:
    distribution_types: "4/4 (normal, lognormal, weighted, ranges)"
    generator_types: "8 built-in generators demonstrated"
    foreign_key_patterns: "2 foreign keys, dual representation"

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority:
    - issue: "Example schema not yet tested with F008 parser implementation"
      impact: "Schema format assumptions may need adjustment when parser is built"
      solution: "Validate schema against parser once F008 is implemented (next feature)"
      estimate: "0.5 hours validation, potential 1-2 hour schema adjustments"
  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Generator parameter validation not documented"
      impact: "Schema authors may create invalid generator configurations"
      solution: "Document parameter requirements in T028-T036 (User Story 3)"
      estimate: "Covered by upcoming tasks"
  low_priority:
    - issue: "No validation_rules testing yet"
      impact: "Format may need refinement based on F008 implementation"
      solution: "Refine during F008 implementation based on actual validation needs"
      estimate: "Minimal, covered by F008 development"
