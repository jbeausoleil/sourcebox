key_decisions:
  - decision: "Used code-documenter agent for all tasks"
    rationale: "This is a design-only feature (documentation, no code implementation)"
    impact: "Consistent documentation style and quality across all sections"

  - decision: "Documented sections incrementally (T003-T009)"
    rationale: "Build up specification in logical order from overview to detailed sections"
    impact: "Each task added ~300-500 lines of focused documentation"

  - decision: "Used fintech domain for all examples"
    rationale: "Realistic, relatable examples (borrowers, loans, credit scores) vs generic foo/bar"
    impact: "Examples are practical and copyable for schema authors"

  - decision: "Added dual versioning in single task (T008)"
    rationale: "schema_version and version are closely related concepts"
    impact: "Clear distinction between format evolution and content evolution"
