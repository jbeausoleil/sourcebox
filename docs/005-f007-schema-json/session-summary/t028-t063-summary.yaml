key_decisions:
  - decision: "Dual foreign key representation (inline + explicit)"
    rationale: "Inline format optimizes for parser implementation (code reads foreign_key object directly), explicit format optimizes for documentation and schema visualization tools"
    impact: "F008 parser will use inline format, schema documentation tools will use explicit relationships section"

  - decision: "Distribution types as core abstraction"
    rationale: "Enables realistic data generation (normal for credit scores, lognormal for loan amounts, weighted for categorical data) without custom code per schema"
    impact: "Schema authors can create verticalized data using declarative distributions instead of custom generators"

  - decision: "Semantic versioning with schema_version vs version distinction"
    rationale: "schema_version tracks format changes (1.0 → 2.0 if JSON structure changes), version tracks content changes (1.0.0 → 1.1.0 for new tables)"
    impact: "F008 can validate schema_version compatibility, schema maintainers can evolve content without breaking parsers"

  - decision: "MySQL/PostgreSQL common subset for data types"
    rationale: "Maximize cross-platform compatibility, avoid database-specific features in MVP"
    impact: "Tier 1 schemas work on both MySQL and PostgreSQL without modification, platform-specific types documented for future tiers"

  - decision: "Built-in generators cover 80% use cases, custom generators enable verticalization"
    rationale: "Built-in generators handle common data (names, emails, dates), custom generators enable industry-specific data (credit_score, loan_amount, diagnosis_code)"
    impact: "Schema authors balance convenience (built-in) with verticalization (custom) based on use case"

test_results:
  summary: "No tests (design-only feature, documentation validation only)"
  validation_checks:
    quickstart_validation: "10/10 passed"
    constitutional_compliance: "5/5 passed"
    json_syntax: "valid"
    tier1_compliance: "4950 records < 5000 limit"

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority: []
  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Distribution parameter validation needs implementation in F008"
      impact: "Invalid parameters (e.g., mean without std_dev) could cause runtime errors"

      estimate: "2 hours (part of F008 validation logic)"

    - issue: "Custom generator implementation strategy not yet defined"
      impact: "Schema authors know custom generators exist but F008 needs to decide: Go plugins, embedded scripts, or hardcoded per-schema"
      solution: "F008 design decision: start with hardcoded custom generators in pkg/generators/custom/, consider plugins in F009+"
      estimate: "4 hours (F008 design phase)"

  low_priority:
    - issue: "Platform-specific data type fallback behavior needs testing"
      impact: "jsonb on MySQL, enum differences may cause subtle bugs"
      solution: "F008 integration tests should verify cross-platform compatibility"
      estimate: "1 hour (F008 test suite)"

    - issue: "Versioning strategy needs validation through real schema evolution"
      impact: "Semantic versioning rules may need refinement after real-world schema updates"

constitutional_compliance:
  - principle: "I. Verticalized > Generic"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "Distribution types (lognormal, weighted, ranges) enable realistic data generation. Custom generators documented for industry-specific data (credit_score, loan_amount, diagnosis_code). Example schema demonstrates fintech verticalization."

  - principle: "II. Speed > Features"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "Tier 1 complexity targets enforced (<5,000 records, <30 seconds). Example schema: 4,950 records (within limit). Performance targets documented for F008 implementation."

  - principle: "IV. Boring Tech Wins"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "JSON format (standard, boring), MySQL/PostgreSQL (proven databases), semantic versioning (industry standard). No experimental formats or technologies."

  - principle: "V. Open Source Forever"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "Schema specification is open documentation (schemas/schema-spec.md). Example schema is MIT licensed. Community can contribute schemas using documented format."

  - principle: "VII. Ship Fast, Validate Early"
    status: "✅ Compliant"
    evidence: "F007 completed in 3.5 days (within 12-week MVP timeline). Incremental delivery: MVP (US1+US4) → full feature (US1-US5). Ready for F008 implementation without ambiguity."

architectural_notes:
  - note: "Schema format designed for declarative data generation"
    rationale: "Distribution types + generator_params enable realistic data without imperative code. F008 parser can execute schemas without custom logic per schema."

  - note: "Dual foreign key representation balances code and documentation needs"
    rationale: "Inline foreign_key object optimizes parser implementation, explicit relationships section optimizes schema documentation and visualization tools."

  - note: "MySQL/PostgreSQL common subset ensures cross-platform compatibility"
    rationale: "Tier 1 schemas (MVP) work on both databases without modification. Platform-specific types documented for advanced use cases (Tier 2+)."

  - note: "Semantic versioning enables safe schema evolution"
    rationale: "schema_version protects parser compatibility (1.0 → 2.0 for breaking format changes), version tracks content evolution (1.0.0 → 1.1.0 for new tables). F008 can validate format compatibility."
