    description: "Confirm constitutional compliance"
    files_modified:
      - "specs/002-f004-project-directory/tasks.md"
    features:
      - "Build time: 2.69s (requirement: < 2 min) - PASS"
      - "Binary sizes: 635KB-729KB compressed (requirement: < 50MB) - PASS"
      - "Cross-compilation: 5 platforms supported - PASS"
      - "All quickstart validation steps passing - PASS"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Build system already met constitutional requirements"
    rationale: "Full build workflow (clean + test + build + build-all) executes in 2.69s, well under 2 minute requirement"
    impact: "No performance optimization needed, build system ready for production use"

  - decision: "Binary sizes significantly under constitutional limit"
    rationale: "Largest binary is 729KB compressed, ~1/70th of the 50MB constitutional limit"
    impact: "Demonstrates effective optimization with -ldflags='-s -w' (strip symbols/debug info)"

  - decision: "CLAUDE.md comprehensive enough for developer onboarding"
    rationale: "Documentation includes all Makefile targets, build conventions, performance targets, and artifact details"
    impact: "New developers can understand build system without reading feature spec or quickstart"
