# KEY DECISIONS

decisions:
  architecture:
    - decision: "Single entry point at cmd/sourcebox/main.go"
      rationale: "Standard Go CLI layout, extensible for future commands"

    - decision: "Minimal business logic in main.go"
      rationale: "Keep CLI thin, push logic to pkg/ when needed"

    - decision: "Version injection at compile time"
      rationale: "No runtime dependency, uses git tags"
      implementation: "git describe --tags --always --dirty"

  build_system:
    - decision: "Sequential builds for build-all (no -j4)"
      rationale: "Simple implementation, already fast enough (2.2s vs 2min target)"
      future_consideration: "Could parallelize if build times grow"

    - decision: "Compressed .gz distribution format"
      rationale: "Reduce download size, standard practice for CLI tools"

    - decision: "Strip debug symbols with -ldflags='-s -w'"
      rationale: "Minimize binary size, acceptable for production CLI"

  testing:
    - decision: "Enhanced test suite via test-writer-fixer agent"
      rationale: "Agent identified missing test cases and edge conditions"
      improvement: "100% coverage with robust error handling tests"

# CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE

constitutional:
  binary_size_limit:
    requirement: "< 50MB compressed"
    actual: "0.61-0.71 MB"
    status: "PASSED"
    margin: "99% under limit"

  build_performance:
    requirement: "< 2 minutes for all platforms"
    actual: "< 2.2 seconds"
    status: "PASSED"
    margin: "60x faster than required"

  test_coverage:
    requirement: ">80% on core packages"
    actual: "100% on cmd/sourcebox"
    status: "PASSED"

# RISKS AND TRIAGE NOTES

risks:
  low:
    - risk: "No parallel builds for cross-compilation"
      impact: "Build time could grow with more complex codebase"
      mitigation: "Already 60x faster than target, can optimize later if needed"

    - risk: "Version injection requires git tags"
      impact: "Untagged commits show commit hash only"
      mitigation: "Acceptable for development, will tag releases"

  none_identified:
    - "Binary sizes well under constitutional limit"
    - "Build system tested on macOS (darwin/arm64)"
    - "Test coverage exceeds requirements"
    - "Clean target properly removes artifacts"

      reason: "Agent identified coverage gaps and improvement opportunities"
      impact: "Higher quality, 100% coverage"
