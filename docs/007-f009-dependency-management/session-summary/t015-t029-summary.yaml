key_decisions:
  - decision: "Added Dependency Management section to CONTRIBUTING.md"

    impact: "Ensures all future dependency changes follow best practices (exact versions, license checks, cleanup)"

  - decision: "Categorized dependencies by purpose in README.md"
    rationale: "Users need to understand what each dependency does and why it's included"
    impact: "Improves transparency and makes dependency updates easier to justify"

  - decision: "Documented quarterly dependency review cadence"
    rationale: "Balance between staying current and avoiding unnecessary churn"
    impact: "Sets expectations for maintenance burden (4 reviews/year)"
