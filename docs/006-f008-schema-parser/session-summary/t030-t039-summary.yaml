key_decisions:
  - decision: "Fail-fast validation strategy"
    rationale: "Return first error encountered instead of accumulating multiple errors - simpler implementation, faster feedback for schema authors"
    impact: "Developers fix errors one at a time, but get clear actionable messages"

  - decision: "Structured error context (table/column indices + names)"
    rationale: "Error messages include both numeric indices (for array position) and names (for readability)"
    impact: "Errors like 'table 0 (users): column 2 (email): column type is required' provide precise debugging context"

  - decision: "Validate primary key count before checking empty columns"
    rationale: "Catches both empty columns array and missing primary key in single validation pass"
    impact: "More specific error message for empty columns case"

  - decision: "Allow empty tables/generation_order arrays but not nil"
    rationale: "Distinguish between field present but empty (valid minimal schema) vs field omitted (validation error)"
    impact: "More flexible for minimal test schemas while still catching missing fields"

  - decision: "Database type validation supports both mysql and postgres"
    rationale: "Matches F007 schema specification for Tier 1 supported databases"
    impact: "Rejects unsupported databases (sqlite, mongodb) with clear error messages"
