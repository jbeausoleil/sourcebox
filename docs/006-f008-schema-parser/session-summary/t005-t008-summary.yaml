      - "4 test cases ready for Phase 3 implementation"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Use DisallowUnknownFields in JSON decoder"
    rationale: "Catch typos and unsupported fields early, fail fast on schema errors"
    impact: "Stricter validation, better user error messages"

  - decision: "Accept io.Reader in ParseSchema (not []byte or string)"
    rationale: "More flexible, supports files/network/memory without duplication"
    impact: "Idiomatic Go pattern, testable with strings.NewReader"

  - decision: "Implement ValidateSchema stub returning nil"
    rationale: "Phase 2 focuses on parsing only, validation is Phase 3"
    impact: "Tests written now, implementation deferred to T009-T025"

  - decision: "Fix struct fields discovered during TDD"
    rationale: "Test-driven development caught 4 omissions from schema-spec.md"
    impact: "Prevented runtime bugs, ensured struct completeness before validation"
