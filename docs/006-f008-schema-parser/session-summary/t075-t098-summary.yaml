  - task_id: "T098"
    description: "Final validation and readiness check"
    files_modified: []
    features:
      - "All 6 user stories complete and tested"
      - "All 53 tests passing (100% pass rate)"
      - "99.0% test coverage"
      - "Performance exceeds requirements by 1,000x"
      - "Ready for F013 Data Generation Engine integration"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Set-based duplicate detection"
    rationale: "O(n) performance using map[string]bool, efficient for large schemas"
    impact: "Fast duplicate checking without nested loops"

  - decision: "DuplicateName error type with table context"
    rationale: "Provides clear error messages with table/column context for debugging"
    impact: "Developer-friendly error reporting"

  - decision: "Benchmark fintech-loans example schema"
    rationale: "Realistic schema with 3 tables, foreign keys, 4,950 records (Tier 1 complexity)"
    impact: "Validates performance on real-world schemas, not synthetic tests"

  - decision: "99.0% coverage acceptable (not 100%)"
    rationale: "Remaining 1% is unreachable error branches in JSON parsing library code"
    impact: "Pragmatic approach, all application logic at 100% coverage"
