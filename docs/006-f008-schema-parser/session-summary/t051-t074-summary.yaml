    features:
      - "Complete generation order validation"

  - task_id: "T069-T074"
    description: "Generation order validation implementation"
    files_modified:
      - "pkg/schema/parser.go"
    features:
      - "ValidateGenerationOrder function"
      - "Set-based duplicate detection (map[string]bool)"
      - "Completeness validation"
      - "Integration into ValidateSchema"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Case-insensitive data type matching"
    rationale: "F007 spec doesn't mandate case, user-friendly to accept INT/Int/int"
    impact: "More flexible schema authoring, reduced friction"

  - decision: "Prefix matching for parameterized types"
    rationale: "varchar(255), decimal(10,2) need to match base type"
    impact: "Handles all valid F007 type formats"

  - decision: "Set-based duplicate detection for generation order"
    rationale: "O(n) performance using map[string]bool"
    impact: "Fast validation even for large schemas"
