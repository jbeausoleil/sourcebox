key_decisions:
  - decision: "Case-insensitive referential action validation"
    rationale: "Improves user experience - accepts 'cascade', 'CASCADE', 'CasCade'"
    impact: "More forgiving schema validation, follows SQL standard conventions"
  - decision: "O(1) table name lookup using map[string]bool"
    rationale: "Linear-time validation critical for <100ms performance target"
    impact: "Efficient foreign key validation even for large schemas"
  - decision: "Fail-fast validation pattern"
    rationale: "Returns first error for clarity (consistent with User Story 2)"
    impact: "Clear, actionable error messages without overwhelming users"

risks_and_backlog:
  high_priority: []
  medium_priority:
    - issue: "Consider validating foreign key column types match referenced column types"
      impact: "Schema with mismatched types could cause runtime errors"
      solution: "Add type compatibility validation in future user story"
      estimate: "2 hours"
    - issue: "Consider validating referenced column is actually a primary key"
      impact: "Schema with foreign keys to non-PK columns could be invalid"
      solution: "Add primary key reference validation in future user story"
      estimate: "2 hours"
  low_priority:
    - issue: "Add benchmark tests for large schemas with many foreign keys"
      impact: "Performance testing for production readiness"
      solution: "Create benchmark suite for validation functions"
