key_decisions:
  - decision: "Use Go 1.25.2 in go.mod directive"
    rationale: "Matches installed system version, exceeds FR-009 minimum requirement of 1.21+"
    impact: "Module uses current stable Go version, ensures compatibility with latest features"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Use minimum 1.21: Rejected - prefer current stable version"
      - "Use 1.22 or 1.23: Rejected - system has 1.25.2 installed"

  - decision: "Use github.com/jbeausoleil/sourcebox as module path"
    rationale: "Matches GitHub repository location, standard Go convention"
    impact: "Module can be imported using standard Go tooling, aligns with FR-009"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Use custom domain: Rejected - premature, adds complexity"
      - "Use different path: Rejected - must match repository location"

  - decision: "Create empty go.sum immediately"
    rationale: "Standard practice, prepares for T009-T012 when dependencies may be added"
    impact: "Complete Go module structure ready for development"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Wait until dependencies added: Rejected - violates task requirements"
