# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Initial Validation (2025-10-14)

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Issues Found**: None

**Summary**:
- Spec is completely technology-agnostic and user-focused
- All 5 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (2x P1, 2x P2, 1x P3)
- 15 functional requirements are specific, measurable, and testable
- 10 success criteria provide concrete, measurable outcomes
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - spec is complete and ready for planning
- Edge cases, dependencies, assumptions, and scope boundaries are well-defined

## Notes

Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
