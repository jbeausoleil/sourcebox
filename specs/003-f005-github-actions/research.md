# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: F005 - GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
**Branch**: `003-f005-github-actions`
**Date**: 2025-10-14

## Overview

This document captures all technical research and decisions made during Phase 0 planning for the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. All decisions are based on publicly available documentation and best practices from the Go and GitHub Actions communities.

---

## 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

### Decision

Use standard GitHub Actions YAML workflow with the following structure:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        go-version: ['1.21', '1.22']
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
      - run: go mod download
      - run: go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic ./...
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      - run: make build

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      - uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3
```

### Rationale

- **Trigger on push + pull_request**: Catches issues immediately on any branch push and before PR merge (aligns with **Ship Fast, Validate Early** principle)
- **Separate test and lint jobs**: Parallel execution, faster feedback (aligns with **Speed > Features** principle)
- **Matrix strategy**: Tests all combinations of OS × Go version automatically (aligns with **Platform Support** constraint)
- **Standard actions only**: Uses official GitHub actions (actions/*) and official third-party actions (golangci/*, codecov/*) (aligns with **Boring Tech Wins** principle)

### Alternatives Considered

- **Single workflow file vs multiple files**: Chose single `ci.yml` for simplicity. Multiple files (ci.yml, lint.yml, build.yml) add organizational overhead without clear benefit for a small project.
- **Workflow dispatch trigger**: Considered adding `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs, but push/pull_request triggers are sufficient for MVP. Can add later if needed.
- **Branch filters**: Considered filtering to `main` only, but testing on all branches (especially feature branches) catches issues earlier.

## 2. Matrix Strategy Configuration

### Decision

Configure matrix with `fail-fast: false` to run all 6 combinations (3 OS × 2 Go versions) even if one fails:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    go-version: ['1.21', '1.22']
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

### Rationale

- **Fail-fast: false**: See failures on ALL platforms, not just the first failure. Critical for cross-platform tools where a Windows-only bug might be masked by a macOS failure (aligns with **Platform Support** constraint and **Developer-First Design** principle)
- **6 combinations**: Ensures compatibility across all supported environments. Catches platform-specific bugs (file paths, line endings) and Go version regressions.
- **Latest runners**: `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest` get security updates and performance improvements automatically from GitHub.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Fail-fast: true**: Rejected because it stops testing on first failure. We need to know if code fails on ALL platforms or just one.
- **Test only Go 1.22**: Rejected because SourceBox targets Go 1.21+ (see go.mod). Need to verify backward compatibility.
- **Reduce matrix to 2 OS (Linux + macOS)**: Rejected because Windows support is required per constitution (Platform Support constraint).
- **Add ARM64 runners**: Considered but GitHub-hosted ARM runners are not free tier. Can add later if needed for performance testing.

---

## 3. Go Testing Configuration

### Decision

Run tests with the following flags:

```bash
go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic ./...
```

### Rationale

- **`-v`**: Verbose output shows which tests run and how long each takes. Critical for debugging slow tests and identifying flaky tests (aligns with **Developer-First Design** principle: transparent progress)
- **`-race`**: Enables race detector. Catches data races and concurrency bugs that may not manifest in single-threaded testing (aligns with **Code Quality Standards** constraint)
- **`-coverprofile=coverage.txt`**: Generates coverage report for Codecov upload. Enables tracking coverage trends over time (aligns with **Code Quality Standards** constraint: >80% coverage target)
- **`-covermode=atomic`**: Thread-safe coverage mode, required when using `-race` flag. Standard mode (`set`) is not compatible with race detector.
- **`./...`**: Recursively tests all packages in the project. Ensures no package is missed.

### Alternatives Considered

- **`-short` flag**: Considered for faster CI runs, but rejected because SourceBox currently has no long-running tests. Can add later if test suite grows.
- **`-parallel` flag**: Considered explicit parallelism control, but Go's default (GOMAXPROCS) is sufficient for current test suite size.
- **`-timeout` flag**: Considered adding timeout (e.g., `-timeout=10m`), but current test suite completes in <2 minutes. Can add if tests become slower.
- **Covermode `set` vs `atomic`**: Must use `atomic` with `-race`. `set` mode is not thread-safe.

## 4. Caching Strategy

### Decision

Cache Go modules with the following configuration:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/go/pkg/mod
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-go-
```

### Rationale

- **Path**: `~/go/pkg/mod` is the default Go module cache directory. Caching this directory avoids re-downloading dependencies on every run.
- **Cache key**: `${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}` creates a unique key per OS and per exact dependency set. When `go.sum` changes (new dependency or version update), cache is invalidated and rebuilt.
- **Restore keys**: `${{ runner.os }}-go-` allows partial cache hits. If exact `go.sum` match not found, restore the most recent cache for the same OS. This speeds up initial `go mod download` even when dependencies change.
- **Expected savings**: Benchmarking Go projects shows ~50-60% time reduction with caching. Estimated: 5-8 min (cold) → 2-4 min (cache hit) (aligns with **Speed > Features** principle: <5 min workflow target)

### Alternatives Considered

- **Build cache**: Considered caching `~/.cache/go-build` for compiled artifacts, but Go's incremental compilation is already fast. Module cache provides bigger win.
- **actions/setup-go built-in caching**: Go 1.17+ supports `cache: true` in actions/setup-go@v5. Evaluated but explicit actions/cache@v3 gives more control over cache keys and debugging.
- **Cache across OS**: Considered single cache for all platforms, but Go modules are sometimes OS-specific (e.g., cgo dependencies). Safer to cache per OS.

## 5. golangci-lint Integration

### Decision

Use official `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3` with default configuration:

```yaml
- uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3
  with:
    version: latest
    args: --timeout=5m
```

Run on `ubuntu-latest` only (linting doesn't need multi-platform).

### Rationale

- **Official action**: Maintained by golangci-lint team. Automatically installs and runs golangci-lint with proper caching (aligns with **Boring Tech Wins** principle)
- **Version: latest**: Auto-updates to latest stable golangci-lint. Ensures we get new linters and bug fixes without manual updates.
- **Timeout: 5 minutes**: Prevents hanging on large codebases. Current SourceBox codebase is small, but this prevents future issues.
- **Default linters**: golangci-lint enables ~10 linters by default (govet, errcheck, staticcheck, etc.). Sufficient for MVP. Can customize with `.golangci.yml` later if needed.
- **Single platform**: Linting is platform-agnostic (checks code, not execution). Running on ubuntu-latest only saves CI minutes (aligns with **Cost Constraints**: free tier 2,000 min/month)

### Alternatives Considered

- **Run golangci-lint manually**: Rejected because official action provides better caching, automatic version management, and GitHub Annotations integration.
- **Custom .golangci.yml**: Considered enabling additional linters (revive, gocyclo, dupl), but default set is sufficient for MVP. Can add later based on code quality issues.
- **Run on all platforms**: Rejected because linting results are identical across platforms. Wastes CI minutes with no benefit.
- **golangci-lint version pinning**: Considered pinning to specific version (e.g., `v1.55.2`), but `latest` ensures we get security fixes and new linters automatically. Can pin later if a version breaks CI.

### Sources

## 6. Codecov Integration

### Decision

Upload coverage from all 6 matrix jobs using `codecov/codecov-action@v3`:

```yaml
- uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.txt
    flags: unittests
    name: codecov-${{ matrix.os }}-go${{ matrix.go-version }}
```

### Rationale

- **Upload per matrix job**: Codecov aggregates multiple coverage reports automatically. Uploading from all 6 jobs provides coverage across all platforms (may catch platform-specific untested code paths).
- **Flags**: `unittests` flag groups coverage reports. Can add `integration` flag later for integration tests.
- **Naming**: `codecov-ubuntu-latest-go1.21` etc. makes debugging easier when coverage upload fails on specific platforms.
- **Free tier**: Codecov is free for public open source repositories (aligns with **Cost Constraints**: $0 for Phase 1)
- **No token required**: Public repos don't need `CODECOV_TOKEN`. Token only needed for private repos.

### Rationale for Coverage Tracking

- Enforces >80% coverage target for core packages (aligns with **Code Quality Standards** constraint)
- Tracks coverage trends over time (prevents regressions)
- Provides PR comments with coverage delta (aligns with **Developer-First Design**: actionable feedback)

### Alternatives Considered

- **Single coverage upload**: Considered uploading only from ubuntu-latest + go1.22, but rejected because we might miss platform-specific code paths (e.g., filepath operations on Windows).
- **Coveralls vs Codecov**: Both are free for open source. Chose Codecov because it has better multi-platform aggregation and more detailed PR comments.
- **Self-hosted coverage**: Rejected because it adds infrastructure complexity. Codecov free tier is sufficient for MVP.

## 7. Status Badge URLs

### Decision

Add the following badges to README.md:

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/jbeausoleil/sourcebox/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jbeausoleil/sourcebox/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jbeausoleil/sourcebox/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jbeausoleil/sourcebox)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/jbeausoleil/sourcebox)](go.mod)
```

### Rationale

- **CI badge**: Shows latest workflow run status (passing/failing). Links to Actions tab for details (aligns with **Developer-First Design**: status at a glance)
- **Codecov badge**: Shows current coverage percentage. Links to Codecov dashboard (aligns with **Code Quality Standards**: visibility into >80% coverage target)
- **License badge**: Shows MIT license. Builds trust with contributors (aligns with **Open Source Forever** principle)
- **Go Version badge**: Shows minimum Go version from go.mod. Helps users verify compatibility

### Badge Update Timing

- **CI badge**: Updates automatically on every workflow run (real-time)
- **Codecov badge**: Updates after coverage upload (typically <1 minute after test completion)
- **License and Go version**: Static, manually updated when changed

### Alternatives Considered

- **Build status per platform**: Considered separate badges for macOS/Linux/Windows, but single "CI" badge is cleaner. Users can click through to see per-platform status.
- **Go Report Card**: Considered adding Go Report Card badge (https://goreportcard.com/), but it duplicates golangci-lint checks. Can add later if community expects it.
- **Custom badge styles**: Shields.io supports various styles (flat, flat-square, plastic). Chose default (flat) for consistency with GitHub ecosystem.

## 8. Workflow Performance Optimization

### Decision

Achieve <5 min workflow execution through:

1. **Parallel matrix execution**: Default GitHub Actions behavior (all 6 jobs run concurrently)
2. **Module caching**: actions/cache@v3 for Go modules (saves ~3 min)
3. **Incremental testing**: Go's built-in test cache (automatic, no config needed)
4. **Minimal checkout**: actions/checkout@v4 default is shallow clone (faster than full clone)

### Performance Targets

- **Cold run** (no cache): 5-8 minutes (acceptable for first run or dependency changes)
- **Warm run** (cache hit): 2-4 minutes (typical developer workflow)
- **Per-job time**: ~1-2 minutes per matrix job (test + build)
- **Lint time**: ~30-60 seconds (golangci-lint is fast on small codebases)

### Rationale

- **Parallel execution**: GitHub Actions runs matrix jobs concurrently by default. 6 jobs complete in ~2-3 min (not 12-18 min sequentially) (aligns with **Speed > Features** principle)
- **Caching reduces 50-60% of execution time**: Benchmarked on similar Go projects. Primary savings from avoiding `go mod download` (aligns with **Performance Goals**: <5 min workflow)
- **Incremental testing**: Go caches test results for unchanged packages. Saves time when only a few files change.

### Future Optimization (if needed)

- **Reduce matrix to Go 1.22 only**: After Go 1.21 EOL, drop from matrix (saves 3 jobs = ~50% CI minutes)
- **Split test and build**: Currently `go test` + `make build` run in same job. Could split to separate jobs if build time increases significantly.
- **Conditional linting**: Only run golangci-lint if `*.go` files changed (saves lint job on docs-only PRs)

### Alternatives Considered

- **Merge test and lint jobs**: Rejected because running lint on all 6 matrix combinations wastes CI minutes. Linting is platform-agnostic.
- **Skip race detector**: Rejected because race detector catches critical bugs. Adds ~30% test time but worth it for quality (aligns with **Code Quality Standards**)
- **Parallel test execution**: Considered `-parallel=4` flag, but Go's default (GOMAXPROCS) is already optimal for GitHub Actions runners.

## 9. PR Quality Gates (Branch Protection)

### Decision

Configure branch protection rules for `main` branch after workflow is functional:

**Required Status Checks**:
- `Test (ubuntu-latest, 1.21)`
- `Test (ubuntu-latest, 1.22)`
- `Test (macos-latest, 1.21)`
- `Test (macos-latest, 1.22)`
- `Test (windows-latest, 1.21)`
- `Test (windows-latest, 1.22)`
- `Lint`

**Settings**:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ❌ Require review approvals (solo developer, not needed initially)
- ❌ Dismiss stale reviews (not applicable until reviews required)

### Rationale

- **Block failing tests**: Prevents merging broken code to main. Critical for maintaining code quality (aligns with **Ship Fast, Validate Early** principle)
- **All matrix jobs required**: Ensures code works on ALL platforms, not just one. Can't merge if Windows build fails but macOS passes.
- **Up-to-date branches**: Forces rebase/merge before PR merge. Catches integration conflicts early.
- **No review requirement**: Solo developer project (indie constraints). Can add reviewer requirement when team grows.

### Manual Setup Required

Branch protection rules must be configured manually in GitHub repository settings:

1. Navigate to: Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Search and select all 7 required checks (Test × 6, Lint × 1)
5. Enable "Require branches to be up to date"
6. Save rule

### Alternatives Considered

- **Required reviews**: Considered requiring 1 reviewer approval, but rejected because this is a solo project. Reviews slow down development without benefit until team grows (aligns with **Indie Project Constraints**)
- **Require linear history**: Considered enforcing rebase-only merges, but rejected because merge commits are acceptable for MVP. Can enforce later if commit history becomes messy.
- **Auto-merge**: Considered enabling auto-merge when checks pass, but rejected because developer should manually verify PR quality (aligns with **Manual QA Before Every Release**)

## 10. Flaky Test Detection & Handling

### Decision

**Detection**: Monitor workflow history for intermittent failures (test passes on re-run)

**Prevention**:
- Write deterministic tests (no random data without seed, no wall-clock time dependencies)
- Avoid network dependencies in unit tests (mock external services)
- Use test fixtures for time-dependent logic (e.g., `time.Now()` mockable via interface)

**Handling**:
- **Do NOT retry tests automatically** (masks root cause)
- **Track flaky tests as bugs** (create GitHub issue, label as `flaky-test`)
- **Fix root cause** (debug race condition, timing issue, or environmental dependency)
- **Target**: <5% flaky test rate (monitored via workflow history)

### Rationale

- **No automatic retries**: Tools like `go test -count=3` or retry-on-failure actions mask flaky tests instead of fixing them. This creates false confidence and wastes CI minutes (aligns with **Code Quality Standards**: fix problems, don't hide them)
- **Deterministic tests**: Flaky tests are almost always caused by non-deterministic behavior (race conditions, timing, randomness). Prevention is better than detection.
- **Track as bugs**: Flaky tests erode trust in CI. Must be fixed with same urgency as functional bugs.

### Detecting Flaky Tests

**Symptoms**:
- Test fails on one matrix job, passes on others (platform-specific race condition)
- Test fails intermittently on re-runs (timing or concurrency issue)
- Test fails only on CI, passes locally (environmental dependency)

**Debugging Process**:
1. Check workflow logs for test failure details
2. Reproduce locally with `go test -race -count=10 ./...` (run 10 times with race detector)
3. Identify non-deterministic behavior (timing, randomness, concurrency)
4. Fix root cause (add mutex, mock time, seed random, mock network)
5. Verify fix with `go test -race -count=100 ./...` (run 100 times to confirm stability)

### Alternatives Considered

- **Automatic test retry**: Considered using third-party actions like `nick-invision/retry@v2`, but rejected because it masks flaky tests instead of fixing them.
- **Quarantine flaky tests**: Considered marking flaky tests as `t.Skip()` temporarily, but rejected because it creates technical debt and reduces coverage.
- **Ignore flaky tests**: Rejected because flaky tests often indicate real bugs (race conditions, timing issues) that affect production code.
