# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `003-f005-github-actions`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "F005 - GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline - Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push and pull request. The workflow will execute tests across multiple Go versions (1.21, 1.22) and operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows), generate coverage reports, and verify builds succeed. A status badge in README.md will show build health at a glance."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Automated Test Execution on Commit (Priority: P1)

**As a developer**, I want all tests to run automatically whenever I push commits to the repository, so that I catch bugs immediately without manual testing.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of CI/CD - preventing bugs from reaching the codebase. Without automated test execution, developers must remember to run tests manually, leading to regressions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing a commit with passing tests and verifying tests execute automatically. Delivers immediate value by catching bugs before code review.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have committed code changes locally, **When** I push to any branch, **Then** the test suite executes automatically within 30 seconds
2. **Given** tests are running, **When** all tests pass, **Then** I see a green checkmark indicating success
3. **Given** tests are running, **When** any test fails, **Then** I see a red X with details about which tests failed
4. **Given** I push to the main branch, **When** tests fail, **Then** I am immediately notified of the failure

---

### User Story 2 - Pull Request Quality Gates (Priority: P1)

**As a code reviewer**, I want to see test results and build status before reviewing a pull request, so that I only review code that passes basic quality checks.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining code quality at scale. Reviewers shouldn't waste time on PRs that don't even compile or pass tests.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a PR and verifying that test results appear in the PR interface before review begins. Delivers value by filtering out broken PRs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I create a pull request, **When** tests start running, **Then** I see a "Checks running" status on the PR
2. **Given** tests complete successfully, **When** I view the PR, **Then** I see a green "All checks passed" status
3. **Given** tests fail, **When** I view the PR, **Then** the PR is blocked from merging with a clear failure message
4. **Given** I push new commits to an open PR, **When** commits are pushed, **Then** tests re-run automatically

---

### User Story 3 - Cross-Platform Build Verification (Priority: P2)

**As a project maintainer**, I want to verify that the project builds successfully on all supported platforms, so that users on different operating systems can install and use the tool.

**Why this priority**: Critical for cross-platform tools, but slightly lower priority than basic test execution. Can be validated after core testing works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a build and verifying success on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Delivers value by catching platform-specific build issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes are pushed, **When** builds run, **Then** compilation succeeds on macOS, Linux, and Windows
2. **Given** a build fails on one platform, **When** viewing results, **Then** I see which platform failed and the specific error
3. **Given** I introduce platform-specific code, **When** tests run, **Then** I am warned if builds fail on any platform

---

### User Story 4 - Code Quality Metrics Visibility (Priority: P2)

**As a developer**, I want to see code coverage and quality metrics automatically, so that I maintain high code quality without manual analysis.

**Why this priority**: Important for maintaining quality standards, but not blocking for basic CI functionality. Can be added after core testing works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing coverage reports after test execution. Delivers value by surfacing quality trends over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tests complete, **When** I view results, **Then** I see the test coverage percentage
2. **Given** coverage drops below 80%, **When** viewing results, **Then** I see a warning about low coverage
3. **Given** I view the project README, **When** checking build status, **Then** I see a badge showing current build status and coverage

---

### User Story 5 - Multi-Version Compatibility Testing (Priority: P3)

**As a project maintainer**, I want to verify compatibility with multiple Go versions, so that users can use the tool regardless of their Go version.

**Why this priority**: Important for compatibility, but lower priority than core functionality. Most users will use recent Go versions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running tests against Go 1.21 and 1.22. Delivers value by ensuring backward compatibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tests run, **When** executing against Go 1.21, **Then** all tests pass
2. **Given** tests run, **When** executing against Go 1.22, **Then** all tests pass
3. **Given** I use Go 1.21-specific features, **When** tests run on Go 1.22, **Then** I see compatibility issues immediately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitHub Actions service is down or unavailable?
- How does the system handle extremely long-running tests (>5 minutes)?
- What happens when tests pass locally but fail in CI environment?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from external services during tests?
- What happens when a workflow is triggered while another is still running?
- How does the system handle flaky tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST execute all tests automatically when code is pushed to any branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute all tests automatically when pull requests are created or updated
- **FR-003**: System MUST run tests on macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems
- **FR-004**: System MUST run tests against Go versions 1.21 and 1.22
- **FR-005**: System MUST report test results within 5 minutes of code push
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent merging pull requests when tests fail
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate test coverage reports for each test run

## Assumptions

- GitHub Actions free tier (2,000 minutes/month) is sufficient for project needs
- Test suite execution time is currently under 2 minutes per platform
- Go module dependencies are stable and cacheable
- Developers have GitHub notifications enabled to receive failure alerts
- Repository is public, enabling free access to GitHub Actions and coverage services
- Standard GitHub-hosted runners provide sufficient performance for builds and tests
- Test suite is already race-condition safe (or will be fixed as issues are found)
- Codecov or similar service will be used for coverage tracking (free for open source)

## Dependencies

**Upstream**:
- F003 (Git Repository): Repository must exist and have remote configured
- F004 (Build System): Makefile and build targets must be functional

**Downstream**:
- All future features benefit from automated testing and quality gates
- Future release automation can build upon this CI/CD foundation

## Out of Scope

- Automated deployment to package registries (will be addressed in future release automation feature)
- Performance benchmarking and trend analysis (may be added later)
- Security scanning and vulnerability detection (separate feature)
- Automated changelog generation (separate feature)
- Integration testing with external services (will be added as features are developed)
- Custom Docker container builds for CI runners (using standard GitHub-hosted runners)
