# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Directory Structure & Build System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Content Quality Assessment
- **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT developers need (directories, build targets) without specifying HOW to implement them technically
- **User value focused**: All user stories describe developer workflows and pain points (navigation, building, testing)
- **Non-technical accessibility**: Written in terms of developer tasks and outcomes, not technical implementation
- **Mandatory sections**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- **No clarification needed**: All requirements are concrete and specific (18 functional requirements defined)
- **Testable requirements**: Every FR has a clear, verifiable condition (e.g., "System MUST provide /cmd/sourcebox directory")
- **Measurable success criteria**: 8 success criteria with specific metrics (e.g., "Build completes in under 30 seconds")
- **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria describe user outcomes, not technical implementation details
- **Acceptance scenarios**: 6 user stories with detailed Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases documented covering error conditions and boundary cases
- **Clear scope**: Out of Scope section explicitly defines what's NOT included
- **Dependencies documented**: Assumptions section lists all prerequisites and constraints

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- **Requirements-criteria alignment**: All 18 FRs map to at least one success criterion
- **User flow coverage**: 6 prioritized user stories cover the complete developer experience (P1-P3)
- **Measurable outcomes**: Each success criterion has quantifiable metrics or observable behaviors
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification remains focused on developer needs without prescribing solutions

## Notes

This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality gates passed on first validation.

The specification successfully describes:
- Directory structure needs (not technical implementation)
- Build system requirements (not Makefile syntax)
- Developer workflows (not code organization)
- Measurable outcomes (not technical metrics)

No updates required before proceeding to planning phase.
