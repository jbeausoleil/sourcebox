# Feature Specification: Cobra CLI Framework Integration

**Feature Branch**: `004-f006-cobra-cli`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "F006 - Cobra CLI Framework Integration"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Get Help and Documentation (Priority: P1)

As a developer exploring SourceBox for the first time, I want to see clear, comprehensive help documentation directly from the command line so I can understand what the tool does and how to use it without reading external documentation.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for all users. Without clear help text, users cannot discover capabilities or learn proper usage, making all other features inaccessible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running help commands and verifying output contains clear descriptions, usage examples, and available commands. Delivers immediate value by enabling self-service learning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have SourceBox installed, **When** I run the help command, **Then** I see a clear description of what SourceBox does and a list of available commands
2. **Given** I want to understand a specific command, **When** I request help for that command, **Then** I see detailed usage instructions, required and optional parameters, and practical examples
3. **Given** I'm unsure about flag options, **When** I view command help, **Then** I see all available flags with their shorthand versions, descriptions, and default values

---

### User Story 2 - Check Version Information (Priority: P1)

As a developer troubleshooting issues or verifying installations, I want to quickly check which version of SourceBox I'm running so I can confirm I have the expected version or report accurate version information when seeking help.

**Why this priority**: Version information is critical for support, troubleshooting, and ensuring users have expected features. This is a baseline requirement for any command-line tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running version command and verifying accurate version string is displayed. Delivers immediate diagnostic value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have SourceBox installed, **When** I check the version, **Then** I see the exact version number in a standard format
2. **Given** I'm running a development build, **When** I check the version, **Then** I see an indicator that distinguishes it from release builds
3. **Given** I need quick version info, **When** I use the short version flag, **Then** I get the same version information without verbose output

---

### User Story 3 - Control Output Verbosity (Priority: P2)

As a developer using SourceBox in different contexts, I want to control how much information the tool displays so I can see detailed debugging information when troubleshooting or suppress noise when running in automated scripts.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability for different use cases (debugging vs production) but core functionality works without it. Users can accomplish tasks with default output levels.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running commands with different verbosity flags and verifying output volume changes appropriately. Delivers value by improving user control over their experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm troubleshooting an issue, **When** I enable verbose mode, **Then** I see detailed progress information and internal operations
2. **Given** I'm running SourceBox in a script, **When** I enable quiet mode, **Then** I see only errors and critical information, no progress messages
3. **Given** I want default behavior, **When** I run without verbosity flags, **Then** I see standard progress information without overwhelming detail

---

### User Story 4 - Use Custom Configuration (Priority: P3)

As a developer working across multiple projects or environments, I want to specify custom configuration files so I can maintain different settings for different use cases without modifying my default configuration.

**Why this priority**: Adds flexibility for advanced users but isn't required for basic functionality. Most users will be satisfied with default configuration behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by specifying config file path and verifying it's used instead of defaults. Delivers value for multi-environment workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a custom configuration file, **When** I specify it via flag, **Then** the tool uses settings from that file instead of default locations
2. **Given** I don't specify a config file, **When** I run commands, **Then** the tool checks standard default locations for configuration
3. **Given** I want to see which config is active, **When** I run in verbose mode, **Then** I see confirmation of which configuration file is being used

---

### User Story 5 - Access Core Commands (Priority: P1)

As a developer ready to use SourceBox, I want to access the primary commands (seed database, list available schemas) through a well-organized command structure so I can accomplish my tasks efficiently.

**Why this priority**: These are the core value-delivering commands. While implementation happens in later features, the command structure must be in place as the foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying commands are registered, show appropriate help text, and acknowledge they're coming in future releases. Delivers immediate value by establishing the interface contract.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to seed a database, **When** I access the seed command, **Then** I see it's available with appropriate help text indicating what it will do
2. **Given** I want to see available schemas, **When** I access the list-schemas command, **Then** I see it's available with a clear description of its purpose
3. **Given** I'm typing commands, **When** I use the short alias for list-schemas, **Then** the tool recognizes the shorter command form

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user provides conflicting flags (e.g., both verbose and quiet mode)?
- How does the system handle invalid command names or typos?
- What happens when help is requested for a non-existent command?
- How does the tool behave when no configuration file exists at the specified path?
- What happens when a user tries to run a subcommand without required arguments?
- How are help messages displayed on terminals with limited width?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a help command that displays overall tool description and available commands
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide detailed help for each individual command showing usage, flags, and examples
- **FR-003**: System MUST display accurate version information including build metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST support a verbose flag that increases output detail across all commands
- **FR-005**: System MUST support a quiet flag that suppresses non-error output across all commands
- **FR-006**: System MUST support a config flag that accepts a custom configuration file path
- **FR-007**: System MUST register a "seed" command with appropriate help text
- **FR-008**: System MUST register a "list-schemas" command with appropriate help text and short alias
- **FR-009**: System MUST show clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid commands or missing arguments
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both long-form flags (--verbose) and short-form flags (-v) where appropriate
- **FR-011**: Help text MUST include practical usage examples for each command
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle conflicting flags gracefully with clear precedence rules
- **FR-013**: Version information MUST be updatable at build time without code changes
- **FR-014**: System MUST exit with appropriate status codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)

### Assumptions

- Standard terminal width assumptions (80+ characters) for help text formatting
- Users have basic command-line familiarity (understand flags, subcommands)
- Default configuration location follows OS conventions (~/.sourcebox.yaml on Unix-like systems)
- Verbose and quiet flags are mutually exclusive (quiet takes precedence if both specified)
- Help requests always succeed even if the requested command doesn't exist (shows available commands)
