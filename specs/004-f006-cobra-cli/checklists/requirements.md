# Specification Quality Checklist: Cobra CLI Framework Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All quality checks passed. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

- Dependencies and assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios
- User stories prioritized (P1, P2, P3)
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes
- Scope boundaries clear (help, version, flags, command structure)
