# Specification Quality Checklist: Schema JSON Format Specification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (All items validated successfully)
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Validator**: Claude Code

### Key Findings
- Specification is complete with no clarification markers needed
- All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentage, compliance rates)
- Documentation-focused approach avoids implementation details
- Clear scope boundaries separate this feature (documentation) from downstream implementation (F008, F010, F016, F018)
- 5 prioritized user stories cover all major use cases
- 8 edge cases identified for validation consideration

### Next Steps
- ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan and tasks
- Alternative: Use `/speckit.clarify` if additional requirements emerge during review

## Notes

- Specification focuses on documentation deliverables (schema-spec.md, example-schema.json)
- No code implementation required for this feature - purely design/specification work
- Example schema will serve as validation of format completeness
- F008 (Schema Parser) will validate this specification is implementable
