# Specification Quality Checklist: Schema Parser & Validator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation items passed

### Details

**Content Quality**: All items passed
- Specification is written in user-focused language without implementation details
- Focus is on what users need (loading schemas, getting clear errors) and why
- Written for developers as the target audience (non-technical from an implementation perspective)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All items passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and specific
- Every functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-009: "System MUST validate that foreign key references point to existing tables")
- Success criteria are all measurable (e.g., SC-001: "under 100 milliseconds", SC-003: "100% of validation rules")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., SC-001 focuses on user experience "receive a parsed schema object" not technical details like "JSON decoder performance")
- All user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section comprehensively covers boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope is clear: parser + validator for schema JSON files per F007 specification
- Dependencies (F007) and assumptions (UTF-8 encoding, file sizes, permissions) are documented

**Feature Readiness**: All items passed
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover all primary flows: happy path (P1), validation errors (P1-P3)
- Success criteria define measurable outcomes for each major capability
- Specification stays focused on requirements without leaking technical choices

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All validation criteria met on first iteration
- No clarifications needed - feature description was comprehensive
