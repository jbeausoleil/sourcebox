# Feature Specification: F003 - Initialize Git Repository & Go Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-f003-initialize-git`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "SourceBox needs a foundational Git repository with proper Go module initialization, clear licensing (MIT), contribution guidelines, and code of conduct. This is the first technical step that enables all subsequent development work. The repository must be public, well-documented, and include a legal notice about independent development to protect the project's legal status."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Clone and Understand Project (Priority: P1)

A developer discovers SourceBox and wants to understand what it is, how to contribute, and what license it uses before deciding to use or contribute to the project.

**Why this priority**: This is the first interaction any potential contributor or user will have with the project. If they can't quickly understand the project's purpose, licensing, and contribution model, they will move on to other projects.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a developer clone the repository and read the README, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING files. Success means they can answer: "What is SourceBox?", "Can I use it commercially?", and "How do I report a bug?"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer finds the SourceBox GitHub repository, **When** they view the repository homepage, **Then** they see a clear project description, badges for build status and license, and the legal independence notice
2. **Given** a developer wants to understand licensing, **When** they open the LICENSE file, **Then** they see the full MIT license text with appropriate copyright information
3. **Given** a developer wants to contribute, **When** they open CONTRIBUTING.md, **Then** they find clear instructions for reporting bugs, requesting features, and submitting pull requests
4. **Given** a developer is concerned about code of conduct, **When** they open CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, **Then** they see the community standards and how to report issues

### User Story 2 - Set Up Local Development Environment (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to clone the repository and verify that the Go module is properly configured so they can start contributing code.

**Why this priority**: Without a working Go module setup, no code development can occur. This is foundational infrastructure that blocks all future development work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by cloning the repository, running `go mod download`, and verifying the module path is correct. Success means a developer can immediately start writing Go code that imports the sourcebox module.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has Go 1.21+ installed, **When** they clone the repository, **Then** they can run `go mod download` without errors
2. **Given** a developer wants to verify module configuration, **When** they inspect go.mod, **Then** they see the correct module path (github.com/jbeausoleil/sourcebox) and Go version (1.21+)
3. **Given** a developer wants to reference the module in their code, **When** they import "github.com/jbeausoleil/sourcebox", **Then** the import resolves correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Understand Contribution Guidelines (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to report a bug or request a feature and needs to understand the process and expectations for different types of contributions.

**Why this priority**: Clear contribution guidelines reduce noise in the issue tracker and help maintainers triage requests more efficiently. This is important for long-term project health but doesn't block initial development.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reading CONTRIBUTING.md and following the instructions for reporting a bug or feature request. Success means a developer knows exactly where to go and what information to provide.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer found a bug, **When** they read CONTRIBUTING.md, **Then** they know to create a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
2. **Given** a developer has a feature idea, **When** they read CONTRIBUTING.md, **Then** they know to create a GitHub issue with a clear description of the problem the feature solves
3. **Given** a developer wants to submit code, **When** they read CONTRIBUTING.md, **Then** they understand the pull request process including coding standards, testing requirements, and review expectations

---

### User Story 4 - Understand Community Standards (Priority: P3)

A contributor wants to understand the expected behavior and values of the SourceBox community to ensure they interact respectfully with other community members.

**Why this priority**: While important for community health, this is less critical than core functionality and contribution mechanics. Most developers will behave appropriately without explicit guidelines, but having them is valuable for addressing issues when they arise.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reading CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and verifying it clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Success means any community member can identify inappropriate behavior and know how to report it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor reads CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, **When** they review the standards, **Then** they understand what behaviors are expected and prohibited
2. **Given** a contributor witnesses inappropriate behavior, **When** they consult CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, **Then** they know how to report the issue and what enforcement mechanisms exist

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer tries to clone the repository without Git installed? (Expected: standard Git error message with instructions to install Git)
- What happens when a developer with Go 1.20 or earlier tries to use the module? (Expected: clear error message indicating minimum Go version requirement)
- What happens when documentation links break (e.g., to CI/CD badges that don't exist yet)? (Expected: broken badge images but no functional impact; will be fixed when F005 implements CI/CD)
- What happens when .gitignore patterns are missing for new tools (e.g., a developer uses JetBrains GoLand instead of VSCode)? (Expected: IDE files may be accidentally committed; can be fixed by updating .gitignore in future PRs)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Repository MUST be publicly accessible on GitHub without authentication
- **FR-002**: Repository MUST contain a LICENSE file with full MIT license text including copyright year and owner name
- **FR-003**: Repository MUST contain a README.md with project name, description, purpose statement, feature list, and legal independence notice
- **FR-004**: README.md MUST display badges for build status, license (MIT), and Go version
- **FR-005**: Repository MUST contain a CONTRIBUTING.md file with instructions for reporting bugs, requesting features, and submitting pull requests
- **FR-006**: CONTRIBUTING.md MUST specify coding standards and expectations for contributions
- **FR-007**: Repository MUST contain a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file with the Contributor Covenant code of conduct
- **FR-008**: Repository MUST be initialized as a Go module with the module path "github.com/jbeausoleil/sourcebox"
- **FR-009**: Go module MUST specify minimum Go version of 1.21 or higher
- **FR-010**: Repository MUST contain a .gitignore file configured to exclude Go binary files, build artifacts, test coverage files, IDE configuration files, and OS-specific files
- **FR-011**: README.md MUST include the legal notice: "SourceBox is developed independently on personal equipment, outside of work hours, with no use of employer resources or proprietary information."
- **FR-012**: .gitignore MUST exclude .env and .env.local files to prevent accidental credential commits
- **FR-013**: All documentation MUST render correctly in GitHub's markdown preview
- **FR-014**: Repository structure MUST remain minimal (no source code directories yet) as per Week 3 scope

### Key Entities

This feature involves configuration and documentation files, not data entities. No key entities to define.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Any developer can clone the repository and run `go mod download` successfully in under 2 minutes (including clone time on typical broadband connection)
- **SC-002**: Repository size remains under 1MB (ensuring fast clones and minimal storage)
- **SC-003**: All documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT) render correctly on GitHub without broken links or formatting issues
- **SC-004**: Developers can answer three key questions after 5 minutes of reviewing documentation: "What is SourceBox?", "What license is it under?", "How do I contribute?"
- **SC-005**: The legal independence notice is prominently visible on the repository homepage (in README above the fold)
- **SC-006**: No proprietary information, employer references, or credentials are present in the repository
- **SC-007**: The Go module path resolves correctly when imported by other Go projects

### Assumptions

- **GitHub Account**: The project owner has a GitHub account with username "jbeausoleil" (derived from the feature description's module path example)
- **Repository Name**: The repository will be named "sourcebox" (lowercase, no special characters) following GitHub conventions
- **Copyright Owner**: The MIT license will use "jbeausoleil" as the copyright owner (or the actual owner's full legal name if different)
- **Build Badge Placeholder**: Build status badge will initially show "no status" until CI/CD is configured in F005
- **Go Version**: Go 1.21+ is chosen as minimum to balance modern features with reasonable adoption (released in 2023)
- **Standard Patterns**: The .gitignore will follow Go community standard patterns from github.com/github/gitignore
- **Contributor Covenant**: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md will use Contributor Covenant v2.1 (current standard as of 2024)
- **No Dependencies Yet**: The go.mod file will list no dependencies initially; dependencies will be added in F009

### Out of Scope

- Creating source code directories (F004 - Project Directory Structure)
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines (F005 - CI/CD Setup)
- Adding dependencies (F009 - Dependency Management)
- Writing any actual Go code beyond go.mod configuration
- Creating GitHub Actions workflows
- Setting up branch protection rules or repository settings
- Creating issue templates or pull request templates
- Setting up project boards or milestones
- Configuring webhooks or integrations
