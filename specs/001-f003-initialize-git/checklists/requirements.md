# Specification Quality Checklist: F003 - Initialize Git Repository & Go Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification is written from a user/developer perspective without prescribing implementation details. While Go module is mentioned, it's a requirement of the feature itself (not an implementation choice - the feature IS about initializing a Go module). All content focuses on what users need, not how to build it.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 14 functional requirements are concrete and testable (e.g., "Repository MUST be publicly accessible", "README.md MUST include legal notice"). No clarification markers needed because the feature description was comprehensive. Success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "clone in under 2 minutes", "developers can answer three key questions after 5 minutes").

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification includes 4 prioritized user stories (2 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3), each independently testable. Edge cases are documented. Scope is clearly bounded with an explicit "Out of Scope" section. Assumptions are documented (e.g., GitHub username, Go version choice rationale).

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - feature description was sufficiently detailed
- Next step: Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- Alternative: Run `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholders want to discuss trade-offs or assumptions before planning
